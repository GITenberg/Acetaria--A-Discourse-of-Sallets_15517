<h2>
<i>Publisher's Note</i>
</h2>

<p>
This edition of Acetaria is a faithful reprint of the First Edition of
1699, with the correction of a few obvious typographical errors, and
those noted in the Errata of the original edition. Whereas no attempt
has been made to reproduce the typography of the original, the spirit
has been retained, and the vagaries of spelling and punctuation have
been carefully followed; also the old-style S [&#383;] has been retained.
Much of the flavour of Acetaria is lost if it is scanned too hurriedly;
and one should remember also that Latin and Greek were the gauge of a
man of letters, and if the titles and quotations seem a bit ponderous,
they are as amusing a conceit as the French and German complacencies of
a more recent generation.

<h2>
<i>Foreword to Acetaria</i>
</h2>

<p>
<span class="smallcap">John Evelyn,</span>
famous for his "Diary," was a friend and contemporary of
Samuel Pepys. Both were conscientious public servants who had held minor
offices in the government. But, while Pepys' diary is sparkling and
redolent of the free manners of the Restoration, Evelyn's is the record
of a sober, scholarly man. His mind turned to gardens, to sculpture and
architecture, rather than to the gaieties of contemporary social life.
Pepys was an urban figure and Evelyn was "county." He represents the
combination of public servant and country gentleman which has been the
supreme achievement of English culture.
</p>
<p>
Horace Walpole said of him in his Catalogue of Engravers, "I must
observe that his life, which was extended to eighty-six years, was a
course of inquiry, study, curiosity, instruction and benevolence."
</p>
<p>
Courtiers, artists, and scientists were his friends. Grinling Gibbons
was brought to the King's notice by Evelyn, and Henry Howard, Duke of
Norfolk, was persuaded by him to present the Arundel Marbles to the
University of Oxford. In London he engaged in divers charitable and
civic affairs and was commissioner for improving the streets and
buildings

<span class="nopagenum">[pg]</span>

in London. He had charge of the sick and wounded of the Dutch
War and also, with the fineness of character typical of his kind, he
remained at his post through the Great Plague. Evelyn was also active
in organizing the Royal Society and became its first secretary.
</p>
<p>
In the country he spent his time studying, writing and in developing
his own and his brother's estates. He translated several French books,
one of them by Nicolas de Bonnefons was entitled "The French Gardener;
instructions how to cultivate all sorts of fruit-trees." Evelyn
undoubtedly knew another book of de Bonnefons called "<i>Les Delices de
la Campagne</i>." Delights of the country, according to de Bonnefons,
consisted largely in delights of the palate, and perhaps it was this
book which suggested to Evelyn to write a cookery-garden book such
as Acetaria. He also translated Jean de la Quintinie's "The Compleat
Gardener." His "Sylva, or a discourse of Forest Trees" was written as
a protest against the destruction of trees in England being carried
on by the glass factories and iron furnaces, and the book succeeded
in inducing landowners to plant millions of trees.
</p>
<p>
The list of Evelyn's writings shows a remarkable diversity in subject
matter. There was a book on numismatics and translations from

<span class="nopagenum">[pg]</span>

the Greek,
political and historical pamphlets, and a book called "Fumifugium or the
inconvenience of the Aer and Smoke of London dissipated," in which he
suggests that sweet-smelling trees should be planted to purify the air
of London. He also wrote a book called "Sculpture, or the History of
Chalcography and Engraving in Copper."
</p>
<p>
Living in the country and cultivating his fruits and vegetables, Evelyn
grew to be an ardent believer in vegetarianism and is probably the first
advocate in England of a meatless diet. He was so keen on preparing
foods without meat that, like another contemporary, Sir Kenelm Digby,
he collected recipes. These, interspersed with delightful philosophic
comments and some directions about gardening, were assembled in the
little book Acetaria. This was published in 1699 along with the ninth
edition of the "Kalendarium Hortense," a gardener's almanac.
</p>
<p>
The material for <i>Acetaria</i> was gathered as early as 1679 with the
idea of making it one chapter of an encyclopedic work on horticulture.
The <i>Plan of a Royal Garden</i>, was Evelyn's outline for that
ambitious work.
</p>
<p>
The recipes are unusual and delicious and some of them are practical
for today, especially for the owner of a garden where pot herbs are

<span class="nopagenum">[pg]</span>

cultivated. Evelyn uses the pot herbs for flavoring soups, egg dishes,
"salletts" and puddings. The eggs with sweet herbs prepared in ramikins
and the pudding flavored with the petals of calendulas are particularly
good.
</p>
<p>
The book reveals his zest for living and the culture of his mind. It
also shows the thought and life of a country gentleman during the reign
of Charles the Second. Evidently, in Evelyn's home, the spirit of
scientific investigation prevailed and there was a delight in new ideas.
Evelyn supervised the garden and knew how to instruct the cook to
prepare new dishes.
</p>
<p>
Although Acetaria is a book of directions for gardening and cooking, it
is not the least didactic but is written in a discoursive style and with
a leisureliness and in a rhythm suited to the slow pace of a horse
trotting through the winding lanes of the English countryside. As we
read, we can almost see the butler bringing a fragrant pudding to the
family assembled around the dining table in the wood-panelled room. Or
again we can almost smell the thyme, mint, and savory growing in tidy
rows in the well-tilled and neatly ordered garden of John Evelyn.

A <a href="#note-1" name="noteref-1" class="noteref"><sup>1</sup></a><i>Chancellor</i>, and a very Learned

Your Lord&#383;hip: So as after all the Difficulties and Hard&#383;hips
the <i>Society</i>

<span class="nopagenum">[pg]</span>

has hitherto gone through; it has thro' the Favour and Protection of its
<i>Pre&#383;idents</i>, not only pre&#383;erv'd its Reputation from the
Malevolence of Enemies and Detracters, but gone on <i>Culminating</i>,
and now <i>Triumphantly</i> in Your Lord&#383;hip: Under who&#383;e
propitious Influence, I am per&#383;waded, it may promi&#383;e it
&#383;elf <i>That</i>, which indeed has hitherto been wanting, to
ju&#383;tifie the Glorious <i>Title</i> it bears of a ROYAL SOCIETY. The
<i>Emancipating</i> it from &#383;ome Remaining and Di&#383;couraging
Circum&#383;tances, which it as yet labours under; among which, that of
a <i>Precarious</i> and un&#383;teady Abode, is not the lea&#383;t.
</p>
<p>
This <i>Honor</i> was re&#383;erv'd for Your Lord&#383;hip; and an
<i>Honor</i>, permit me

<span class="nopagenum">[pg]</span>

to call it, not at all unworthy the Owning of the Greate&#383;t Person
living: Namely, the E&#383;tabli&#383;hing and Promoting <i>Real
Knowledge</i>; and (next to what is <i>Divine</i>) truly &#383;o called;
as far, at lea&#383;t, as Humane Nature extends towards the Knowledge of
Nature, by enlarging her Empire beyond the Land of <i>Spectres, Forms,
Intentional Species, Vacuum, Occult Qualities</i>, and other
<i>Inadequate Notions</i>; which, by their Ob&#383;treperous and
Noi&#383;y Di&#383;putes, affrighting, and (till of late) deterring Men
from adventuring on further Di&#383;coveries, confin'd them in a lazy
Acquie&#383;cence, and to be fed with <i>Fanta&#383;ms</i> and
fruitle&#383;s Speculations, which &#383;ignifie nothing to the
<i>&#383;pecifick</i> Nature of Things,

<span class="nopagenum">[pg]</span>

solid and u&#383;eful knowledge; by the <i>Inve&#383;tigation of
Cau&#383;es, Principles, Energies, Powers</i>, and <i>Effects</i> of
<i>Bodies</i>, and <i>Things Vi&#383;ible</i>; and to improve them for
the Good and Benefit of Mankind.
</p>
<p>
<i>My Lord</i>, That which the <i>Royal Society</i> needs to
accompli&#383;h an entire Freedom, and (by rendring their
Circum&#383;tances more ea&#383;ie) capable to &#383;ub&#383;i&#383;t
with Honor, and to reach indeed the Glorious Ends of its
<i>In&#383;titution</i>, is an E&#383;tabli&#383;hment in a more
Settl'd, <i>Appropriate</i>, and <i>Commodious Place</i>; having
hitherto (like the <i>Tabernacle</i> in the <i>Wilderne&#383;s</i>) been
only <i>Ambulatory</i> for almo&#383;t <i>Forty Years</i>: But
<i>Solomon</i> built the Fir&#383;t <i>Temple</i>; and what forbids us
to hope,

<span class="nopagenum">[pg]</span>

that as Great a <i>Prince</i> may build <i>Solomon's Hou&#383;e</i>, as
that Great <i>Chancellor</i> (one of Your Lord&#383;hip's Learned
<i>Predece&#383;&#383;ors</i>) had de&#383;ign'd the <i>Plan</i>; there
being nothing in that <i>Augu&#383;t</i> and <i>Noble Model</i>
impo&#383;&#383;ible, or beyond the <i>Power</i> of <i>Nature</i> and
Learned Indu&#383;try.

</p><p>

Thus, whil&#383;t King <i>Solomon's</i> Temple was
<i>Con&#383;ecrated</i> to the <i>God</i> of <i>Nature</i>, and his true
Wor&#383;hip; <i>This</i> may be <i>Dedicated</i>, and &#383;et apart
for the <i>Works</i> of <i>Nature</i>; deliver'd from those
Illu&#383;ions and Impo&#383;tors, that are &#383;till endeavouring to
cloud and depre&#383;s the True, and <i>Sub&#383;tantial
Philo&#383;ophy</i>: A <i>&#383;hallow</i> and <i>Superficial
In&#383;ight</i>, wherein (as that Incomparable Per&#383;on rightly
ob&#383;erves) having

<span class="nopagenum">[pg]</span>

made &#383;o many <i>Athei&#383;ts</i>: whil&#383;t a <i>profound</i>
and thorow <i>Penetration</i> into her <i>Rece&#383;&#383;es</i> (which
is the <i>Bu&#383;ine&#383;s</i> of the <i>Royal Society</i>) would lead
Men to the <i>Knowledge</i>, and <i>Admiration</i> of the <i>Glorious
Author</i>.

</p><p>

And now, <i>My Lord</i>, I expect &#383;ome will wonder what my Meaning
is, to u&#383;her in a <i>Trifle</i>, with &#383;o much Magnificence,
and end at last in a fine <i>Receipt</i> for the
<i>Dre&#383;&#383;ing</i> of a <i>Sallet</i> with an Handful of
<i>Pot-Herbs</i>! But yet, <i>My Lord</i>, this <i>Subject</i>, as low
and de&#383;picable as it appears, challenges a Part of <i>Natural
History</i>, and the Greate&#383;t Princes have thought it no
Di&#383;grace, not only to make it their <i>Diver&#383;ion</i>, but
their <i>Care</i>, and to promote and encourage it in the mid&#383;t

<span class="nopagenum">[pg]</span>

of their weightie&#383;t Affairs: He who wrote of the <i>Cedar</i> of
<i>Libanus</i>, wrote al&#383;o of the <i>Hy&#383;op which grows upon
the Wall</i>.

</p><p>

To verifie this, how much might I &#383;ay of <i>Gardens</i> and
<i>Rural Employments</i>, preferrable to the Pomp and Grandeur of other
Secular Bu&#383;ine&#383;s, and that in the E&#383;timate of as Great
Men as any Age has produc'd! And it is of &#383;uch <i>Great Souls</i>
we have it recorded; That after they had perform'd the Noble&#383;t
Exploits for the Publick, they &#383;ometimes chang'd their
<i>Scepters</i> for the <i>Spade</i>, and their <i>Purple</i> for the
Gardiner's <i>Apron</i>. And of the&#383;e, &#383;ome, My <i>Lord</i>,
were <i>Emperors, Kings, Con&#383;uls, Dictators</i>, and Wi&#383;e
<i>State&#383;men</i>; who amid&#383;t the most

<span class="nopagenum">[pg]</span>

important Affairs, both in Peace and War, have quitted all their Pomp
and Dignity in Exchange of this Learned Plea&#383;ure: Nor that of the
mo&#383;t <i>refin'd</i> Part of <i>Agriculture</i> (the
<i>Philo&#383;ophy</i> of the <i>Garden</i> and <i>Parterre</i> only)
but of <i>Herbs</i>, and whole&#383;om <i>Sallets</i>, and other plain
and u&#383;eful Parts of <i>Geoponicks</i>, and Wrote <i>Books</i> of
<i>Tillage</i> and <i>Husbandry</i>; and took the <i>Plough-Tackle</i>
for their <i>Banner</i>, and their <i>Names</i> from the <i>Grain</i>
and <i>Pul&#383;e</i> they &#383;ow'd, as the Marks and Characters of
the highe&#383;t Honor.

</p><p>

But I proceed no farther on a <i>Topic</i> &#383;o well known to Your
Lord&#383;hip: Nor urge I Examples of &#383;uch Illu&#383;trious
Per&#383;ons laying a&#383;ide their Grandeur, and even of
de&#383;erting their Stations;

<span class="nopagenum">[pg]</span>

(which would infinitely prejudice the Publick, when worthy Men are in
Place, and at the Helm) But to &#383;hew how con&#383;i&#383;ent the
Diver&#383;ions of the <i>Garden</i> and <i>Villa</i> were, with the
highe&#383;t and bu&#383;ie&#383;t Employment of the
<i>Commonwealth</i>, and never thought a Reproch, or the lea&#383;t
Diminution to the Gravity and Veneration due to their Per&#383;ons, and
the Noble Rank they held.

</p><p>

Will Your Lord&#383;hip give me Leave to repeat what is &#383;aid of the
Younger <i>Pliny</i>, (Nephew to the <i>Naturali&#383;t</i>) and whom I
think we may parallel with the Greate&#383;t of his time (and perhaps of
any &#383;ince) under the Worthie&#383;t <i>Emperor</i> the <i>Roman</i>
world ever had? A Per&#383;on of va&#383;t Abilities, Rich,

<span class="nopagenum">[pg]</span>

and High in his Ma&#383;ter's Favour; that &#383;o Husbanded his time,
as in the Mid&#383;t of the weightie&#383;t Affairs, to have
An&#383;wer'd, and by his
<a href="#note-2" name="noteref-2" class="noteref"><sup>2</sup></a><i>Example</i>, made good what I have
&#383;aid on this Occa&#383;ion. The Ancient and be&#383;t
Magi&#383;trates of <i>Rome</i> allow'd but the <i>Ninth</i> Day for the
<i>City</i> and <i>Publick Bu&#383;ine&#383;s</i>; the re&#383;t for the
<i>Country</i> and the <i>Sallet Garden</i>: There were then fewer
<i>Cau&#383;es</i> indeed at the <i>Bar</i>; but never greater
<i>Ju&#383;tice</i>, nor <i>better Judges</i> and <i>Advocates</i>. And
'tis hence ob&#383;erved, that we hardly find a Great and Wise Man among
the Ancients, <i>qui nullos habuit hortos</i>,

<span class="nopagenum">[pg]</span>

excepting only <i>Pomponius Atticus</i>; wil&#383;t his Dear
<i>Cicero</i> profe&#383;&#383;es, that he never laid out his Money more
readily, than in the purcha&#383;ing of <i>Gardens</i>, and tho&#383;e
&#383;weet Retirements, for which he &#383;o often left the
<i>Ro&#383;tra</i> (and Court of the Greate&#383;t and mo&#383;t
flouri&#383;hing State of the World) to vi&#383;it, prune, and water
them with his own Hands.

</p><p>

But, <i>My Lord</i>, I forget with whom I am talking thus; and a
<i>Gardiner</i> ought not to be &#383;o bold. The pre&#383;ent I humbly
make your Lord&#383;hip, is indeed but a <i>Sallet</i> of <i>Crude
Herbs</i>: But there is among them that which was a <i>Prize</i> at the
<i>I&#383;thmian Games</i>; and Your Lord&#383;hip knows who it was both
accepted, and rewarded as de&#383;picable

<span class="nopagenum">[pg]</span>

an Oblation of this kind. The Favor I humbly beg, is Your
Lord&#383;hip's Pardon for this Pre&#383;umption. The Subject is
<i>mean</i>, and requires it, and my <i>Reputation</i> in danger; should
Your Lord&#383;hip hence &#383;u&#383;pect that one could never write
&#383;o much of <i>dre&#383;&#383;ing Sallets</i>, who minded anything
&#383;erious, be&#383;ides the gratifying a Sen&#383;ual Appetite with a
Voluptuary <i>Apician</i> Art.

</p><p>

Truly, <i>My Lord</i>, I am &#383;o far from de&#383;igning to promote
tho&#383;e <i>Supplicia Luxuri&aelig;</i>, (as <i>Seneca</i> calls them)
by what I have here written; that were it in my Power, I would recall
the World, if not altogether to their Pri&#383;tine <i>Diet</i>, yet to
a much more <i>whol&#383;ome</i> and <i>temperate</i> than is now in
Fa&#383;hion: And what if they find me

<span class="nopagenum">[pg]</span>

like to &#383;ome who are eager after <i>Hunting</i> and other
Field-Sports, which are <i>Laborious</i> Exerci&#383;es? and
<i>Fi&#383;hing</i>, which is indeed a <i>Lazy</i> one? who, after all
their Pains and Fatigue, never eat what they take and catch in either:
For &#383;ome &#383;uch I have known: And tho' I cannot affirm &#383;o
of my &#383;elf, (when a well dre&#383;t and excellent <i>Sallet</i> is
before me) I am yet a very moderate Eater of them. So as to this
<i>Book-Luxury</i>, I can affirm, and that truly what the <i>Poet</i>
&#383;ays of him&#383;elf (on a le&#383;s innocent Occa&#383;ion)
<i>La&#383;civa pagina, vita proba.</i> God forbid, that after all I
have advanc'd in Prai&#383;e of <i>Sallets</i>, I &#383;hould be thought
to plead for the Vice I cen&#383;ure, and chu&#383;e that of
<i>Epicurus</i> for my <i>Lemma</i>; <i>In hac arte</i>

<span class="nopagenum">[pg]</span>

<i>con&#383;enui</i>; or to have &#383;pent my time in nothing
el&#383;e. The <i>Plan</i> annext to the&#383;e Papers, and the
<i>Apparatus</i> made to &#383;uper&#383;truct upon it, would acquit me
of having bent all my Contemplations on <i>Sallets</i> only. What I
humbly offer Your Lord&#383;hip, is (as I &#383;aid) Part of <i>Natural
Hi&#383;tory</i>, the Product of <i>Horticulture</i>, and the
<i>Field</i>, dignified by the mo&#383;t illu&#383;trious, and
&#383;ometimes tilled <i>Laureato Vomere</i>; which, as it concerns a
Part of <i>Philo&#383;ophy</i>, I may (without Vanity) be allow'd to
have taken &#383;ome Pains in Cultivating, as an inferior Member of the
<i>Royal Society</i>.

</p><p>

But, <i>My Lord</i>, wil&#383;t You read on (if at lea&#383;t You
vouch&#383;afe me that Honor to read at all) I am con&#383;cious

<span class="nopagenum">[pg]</span>

I rob the Publick of its mo&#383;t Precious Moments.

</p><p>

I therefore Humbly again Implore Your Lord&#383;hip's Pardon: Nor indeed
needed I to have &#383;aid half this, to kindle in Your Brea&#383;t,
that which is already &#383;hining there (Your Lord&#383;hip's
E&#383;teem of the <i>Royal Society</i>) after what You were pleas'd to
Expre&#383;s in &#383;uch an Obliging manner, when it was lately to wait
upon Your Lord&#383;hip; among whom I had the Honor to be a Witne&#383;s

<i>Favourable Entertainment which the</i> Kalendar <i>has found,

remaining, or farther to be expected from the Field; and that</i> Nature

tho&#383;e who thus magnifie their Di&#383;coveries, have after all,
penetrated but a very little Way into this Va&#383;t, Ample, and as yet,

Solomon, Ari&#383;totle, Theophra&#383;tus, Dio&#383;corides, <i>and the
re&#383;t of Nature's Interpreters, had ever arriv'd to the perfect

<i>We have heard of one who &#383;tudied and contemplated the Nature
of</i> Bees <i>only, for</i> Sixty Years: <i>After which, you will not
wonder, that a Per&#383;on of my Acquaintance, &#383;hould have
&#383;pent</i>

<span class="nopagenum">[pg]</span>

<i>almo&#383;t</i> Forty, <i>in Gathering and Ama&#383;&#383;ing
Materials for an</i> Hortulan <i>De&#383;ign, to &#383;o enormous an
Heap, as to fill &#383;ome</i> Thou&#383;and Pages; <i>and yet be
comprehended within two, or three Acres of Ground; nay, within the
Square of le&#383;s than</i> One (<i>&#383;kilfully Planted and
Cultivated) &#383;ufficient to furni&#383;h, and entertain his Time and
Thoughts all his Life long, with a mo&#383;t Innocent, Agreeable, and
U&#383;eful Employment. But you may ju&#383;tly wonder, and Condemn the
Vanity of it too, with that Reproach</i>, This Man began to build, but
was not able to fini&#383;h! <i>This has been the Fate of that
Undertaking; and I dare promi&#383;e, will be of who&#383;oever imagines

<i>But this is that which</i> Abortives <i>the Perfection of the

Coveting to Exhau&#383;t all that &#383;hould, or can be &#383;aid upon
every Head: If &#383;uch a one have any thing el&#383;e to mind, or do
in the World, let me tell him, he thinks of Building too late; and
rarely find we any, who care to &#383;uper&#383;truct upon the
Foundation of another, and who&#383;e</i> Ideas <i>are alike. There
ought therefore to be as many</i> Hands, <i>and</i> Sub&#383;idiaries

<i>too</i>) <i>as there are

in general con&#383;i&#383;t of certain <i>E&#383;culent</i> Plants and
Herbs, improv'd by Culture, Indu&#383;try, and Art of the

render them grateful to the more feminine Palat, or Herbs rather for the

Furniture <i>and</i> Materials
</h3>

<p style="text-indent: 0;"> <span class="dropcap">T</span> <span
class="smallcap">he</span> <i>Materials</i> of <i>Sallets</i>, which
together with the gro&#383;&#383;er <i>Olera</i>, con&#383;i&#383;t of
<i>Roots, Stalks, Leaves, Buds, Flowers</i>, &amp;c. <i>Fruits</i>
(belonging to another Cla&#383;s) would require a much ampler Volume,
than would &#383;uit our Kalendar, (of which this pretends to be an
<i>Appendix</i> only) &#383;hould we extend the following
<i>Catalogue</i> further than to a brief enumeration only of &#383;uch
<i>Herbaceous</i> Plants, <i>Olu&#383;cula</i> and smaller
<i>E&#383;culents</i>, as are chiefly us'd in <i>Cold Sallets</i>, of
whose Culture we have treated there; and as

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page5" name="page5"></a>[5]</span>

we gather them from the <i>Mother</i> and <i>Genial Bed</i>, with a
touch only of their <i>Qualities</i>, for Reasons hereafter given.

</p>
<p>

1. Alexanders, <i>Hippo&#383;elinum; S. Smyrnium vulgare</i> (much of
the nature of <i>Per&#383;ly</i>) is moderately hot, and of a
clean&#383;ing Faculty, Deob&#383;tructing, nouri&#383;hing, and
comforting the Stomach. The gentle fre&#383;h Sprouts, Buds, and Tops
are to be cho&#383;en, and the Stalks eaten in the Spring; and when
<i>Blanch'd</i>, in Winter likewi&#383;e, with <i>Oyl, Pepper, Salt</i>,
&amp;c. by them&#383;elves, or in Compo&#383;ition: They make al&#383;o
an excellent <i>Vernal</i> Pottage.

</p>
<p>

2. Artichaux, <i>Cinara</i>, (<i>Carduus Sativus</i>) hot and dry. The
Heads being &#383;lit in quarters fir&#383;t eaten raw, with <i>Oyl</i>,
a little <i>Vinegar, Salt</i>, and <i>Pepper</i>, gratefully recommend a
Gla&#383;s of <i>Wine</i>; Dr. <i>Muffet</i> &#383;ays, at the end of
Meals.

</p><p>

They are likewi&#383;e, whil&#383;t tender and &#383;mall, fried in
fre&#383;h <i>Butter</i> cri&#383;p with <i>Per&#383;ley</i>. But then
become a mo&#383;t delicate and excellent Re&#383;torative, when full
grown, they are boil'd the common way. The <i>Bottoms</i> are al&#383;o
bak'd in <i>Pies</i>, with <i>Marrow, Dates</i>, and other rich
Ingredients: In <i>Italy</i> they &#383;ometimes broil them, and as the
Scaly Leaves open, ba&#383;te them with fre&#383;h and &#383;weet
<i>Oyl</i>; but with Care extraordinary,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page6" name="page6"></a>[6]</span>

for if a drop fall upon the Coals, all is marr'd; that hazard
e&#383;cap'd, they eat them with the Juice of <i>Orange</i> and
<i>Sugar</i>.

</p><p>

The Stalk is <i>Blanch'd</i> in Autumn, and the <i>Pith</i> eaten raw or
boil'd. The way of pre&#383;erving them fre&#383;h all Winter, is by
&#383;eparating the <i>Bottoms</i> from the <i>Leaves</i>, and after
Parboiling, allowing to every <i>Bottom</i>, a &#383;mall earthen glaz'd
Pot; burying it all over in fre&#383;h melted <i>Butter</i>, as they do
Wild-Fowl, <i>&amp;c.</i> Or if more than one, in a larger Pot, in the
&#383;ame Bed and Covering, <i>Layer</i> upon <i>Layer</i>.

</p><p>

They are al&#383;o pre&#383;erv'd by &#383;tringing them on Pack-thread,
a clean Paper being put between every <i>Bottom</i>, to hinder them from
touching one another, and &#383;o hung up in a dry place. They are
likewi&#383;e <i>Pickl'd</i>.

</p><p>

'Tis not very long &#383;ince this noble <i>Thi&#383;tle</i> came
fir&#383;t into <i>Italy</i>, Improv'd to this Magnitude by Culture; and
&#383;o rare in <i>England</i>, that they were commonly &#383;old for
<i>Crowns</i> a piece: But what <i>Carthage</i> yearly &#383;pent in
them (as <i>Pliny</i> computes the Sum) amounted to <i>Se&#383;tertia
Sena Millia</i>, 30000 <i>l. Sterling</i>.

</p>
<p>

<i>Note</i>, That the <i>Spani&#383;h Cardon</i>, a wild and
&#383;maller <i>Artichoak</i>, with &#383;harp pointed Leaves, and
le&#383;&#383;er Head; the Stalks being <i>Blanch'd</i> and

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page7" name="page7"></a>[7]</span>

tender, are &#383;erv'd-up <i>a la Poiverade</i> (that is with <i>Oyl,
Pepper</i>, &amp;c.) as the <i>French</i> term is.

</p>
<p>

3. Ba&#383;il, <i>Ocimum</i> (as <i>Baulm</i>) imparts a grateful
Flavour, if not too &#383;trong, &#383;omewhat offen&#383;ive to the
Eyes; and therefore the tender Tops to be very &#383;paringly us'd in
our <i>Sallet</i>.

</p>
<p>

4. Baulm, <i>Meli&#383;&#383;a, Baum</i>, hot and dry, Cordial and
exhilarating, &#383;overeign for the Brain, &#383;trengthning the
Memory, and powerfully cha&#383;ing away <i>Melancholy</i>. The tender
Leaves are us'd in Compo&#383;ition with other Herbs; and the Sprigs
fre&#383;h gather'd, put into <i>Wine</i> or other Drinks, during the
heat of Summer, give it a marvellous quickne&#383;s: This noble Plant
yields an incomparable <i>Wine</i>, made as is that of
<i>Cow&#383;lip</i>-Flowers.

</p>
<p>

5. Beet, <i>Beta</i>; of which there is both <i>Red, Black</i>, and
<i>White</i>: The <i>Co&#383;ta</i>, or Rib of the <i>White Beet</i> (by
the <i>French</i> call'd the <i>Chard</i>) being boil'd, melts, and eats
like Marrow. And the <i>Roots</i> (e&#383;pecially of the <i>Red</i>)
cut into thin &#383;lices, boil'd, when cold, is of it &#383;elf a
grateful winter <i>Sallet</i>; or being mingl'd with other
<i>Olu&#383;cula, Oyl, Vinegar, Salt</i>, &amp;c. 'Tis of quality Cold
and Moi&#383;t, and naturally &#383;omewhat <i>Laxative</i>:

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page8" name="page8"></a>[8]</span>

But however by the <i>Epigrammati&#383;t</i> &#383;til'd
<i>Fooli&#383;h</i> and <i>In&#383;ipid, as Innocentior quam Olus</i>
(for &#383;o the Learned
<a href="#note-14" name="noteref-14" class="noteref"><sup>14</sup></a><i>Harduin</i> reads the place) 'tis by
<i>Diphilus</i> of old, and others &#383;ince, preferr'd before
<i>Cabbage</i> as of better Nouri&#383;hment: <i>Martial</i> (not
unlearn'd in the Art of <i>Sallet</i>) commends it with <i>Wine</i> and
<i>Pepper</i>: He names it indeed&mdash;<i>Fabrorum prandia</i>, for its
being &#383;o vulgar. But eaten with <i>Oyl</i> and <i>Vinegar</i>, as
u&#383;ually, it is no de&#383;picable <i>Sallet</i>. There is a
<i>Beet</i> growing near the Sea, which is the mo&#383;t delicate of
all. The Roots of the <i>Red Beet</i>, pared into thin Slices and
Circles, are by the <i>French</i> and <i>Italians</i> contriv'd into
curious Figures to adorn their <i>Sallets</i>.

</p>
<p>

<i>6</i>. Blite, <i>Blitum</i>; Engli&#383;h <i>Mercury</i>, or (as our
Country Hou&#383;e wives call it) <i>All-good</i>, the gentle
<i>Turiones</i>, and Tops may be eaten as <i>Sparagus</i>, or
&#383;odden in Pottage: There is both a white and red, much us'd in
<i>Spain</i> and <i>Italy</i>; but be&#383;ides its humidity and
deter&#383;ive Nature, 'tis <i>In&#383;ipid</i> enough.

</p>
<p>

7. Borrage, <i>Borrago</i> (<i>Gaudia semper ago</i>) hot and kindly
moi&#383;t, purifying the Blood, is an

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page9" name="page9"></a>[9]</span>

exhilarating Cordial, of a plea&#383;ant Flavour: The tender Leaves, and
Flowers e&#383;pecially, may be eaten in Compo&#383;ition; but above
all, the Sprigs in <i>Wine</i>, like tho&#383;e of <i>Baum</i>, are of
known Vertue to revive the <i>Hypochondriac</i>, and chear the hard
Student. See <i>Buglo&#383;s</i>.

</p>
<p>

8. Brooklime, <i>Anagallis aquatica</i>; moderately hot and moi&#383;t,
prevalent in the <i>Scorbute</i>, and <i>Stone</i>.

</p>
<p>

9. Buglo&#383;s, <i>Buglo&#383;&#383;um</i>; in mature much like
<i>Borrage</i>, yet &#383;omething more a&#383;tringent. The Flowers of
both, with the intire Plant, greatly re&#383;torative, being
Con&#383;erv'd: And for the re&#383;t, &#383;o much commended by
<i>Averroes</i>; that for its effects, cheri&#383;hing the Spirits,
ju&#383;tly call'd <i>Euphro&#383;ynum</i>; Nay, &#383;ome will have it
the <i>Nepenthes</i> of <i>Homer</i>: But indeed, what we now call
<i>Buglo&#383;s</i>, was not that of the Ancients, but rather
<i>Borrage</i>, for the like Virtue named <i>Corrago</i>.

</p>
<p>

Burnet, See <i>Pimpinella</i>.

</p>
<p>

10. Buds, <i>Gemm&aelig;, Turiones</i>; the fir&#383;t Rudiments and
Tops of mo&#383;t <i>Sallet</i>-Plants, preferrable to all other
le&#383;s tender Parts; &#383;uch as <i>A&#383;hen-Keys, Broom-buds</i>,
hot and dry, retaining

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page10" name="page10"></a>[10]</span>

the vertue of <i>Capers</i>, e&#383;teem'd to be very opening, and
prevalent again&#383;t the <i>Spleen</i> and <i>Scurvy</i>; and being
<i>Pickl'd</i>, are &#383;prinkl'd among the <i>Sallets</i>, or eaten by
them&#383;elves.

</p>
<p>

11. Cabbage, <i>Bra&#383;&#383;ica</i> (and its &#383;everal kinds)
<i>Pompey's</i> beloved Di&#383;h, &#383;o highly celebrated by old <a
href="#note-15" name="noteref-15"
class="noteref"><sup>15</sup></a><i>Cato</i>, <i>Pythagoras</i>, and
<i>Chry&#383;ippus</i> the Phy&#383;ician (as the only <i>Panacea</i>)
is not &#383;o generally magnify'd by the re&#383;t of Doctors, as
affording but a cra&#383;s and melancholy Juice; yet
<i>Loo&#383;ening</i> if but moderately boil'd, if over-much,
<i>A&#383;tringent</i>, according to <i>C. Cel&#383;us</i>; and
therefore &#383;eldom eaten raw, excepting by the <i>Dutch</i>. The
<i>Cym&aelig;</i>, or Sprouts rather of the <i>Cole</i> are very
delicate, &#383;o boil'd as to retain their Verdure and green Colour. In
rai&#383;ing this <i>Plant</i> great care is to be had of the Seed. The
be&#383;t comes from <i>Denmark</i> and <i>Ru&#383;&#383;ia</i>,
e&#383;pecially the <i>Cauly-flower</i>, (anciently unknown) or from
<i>Aleppo</i>. Of the <i>French</i>, the <i>Pancaliere a la large
Cost&eacute;</i>, the white, large and ponderous are to be cho&#383;en;
and &#383;o the <i>Cauly-flower</i>: After boiling &#383;ome &#383;teep
them in Milk, and &#383;eethe them again in Beef-Broth: Of old they
added a little <i>Nitre</i>. The <i>Broccoli</i> from <i>Naples</i>,
perhaps the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page11" name="page11"></a>[11]</span>

<i>Halmyridia</i> of <i>Pliny</i> (or <i>Athen&aelig;us</i> rather)
<i>Capiata marina</i> &amp; <i>florida</i>, our <i>Sea-keele</i> (the
ancient <i>Crambe</i>) and growing on our Coa&#383;t, are very delicate,
as are the <i>Savoys</i>, commended for being not &#383;o rank, but
agreeable to mo&#383;t <i>Palates</i>, and of better Nouri&#383;hment:
In general, <i>Cabbages</i> are thought to allay Fumes, and prevent
Intoxication: But &#383;ome will have them noxious to the Sight; others
impute it to the <i>Cauly-flower</i> rather: But whil&#383;t the Learned
are not agreed about it, <i>Theophra&#383;tus</i> affirms the contrary,
and <i>Pliny</i> commends the Juice raw, with a little <i>Honey</i>, for
the moi&#383;t and weeping Eye, not the dry or dull. But after all,
<i>Cabbage</i> ('tis confe&#383;s'd) is greatly accus'd for lying
undige&#383;ted in the Stomach, and provoking Eructations; which makes
me wonder at the Veneration we read the Ancients had for them, calling
them <i>Divine</i>, and Swearing, <i>per Bra&#383;&#383;icam</i>. 'Tis
&#383;carce an hundred Years &#383;ince we fir&#383;t had
<i>Cabbages</i> out of <i>Holland</i>. Sir <i>Anth. A&#383;hley</i> of
<i>Wiburg St. Giles</i> in <i>Dor&#383;et&#383;hire</i>, being (as I am
told) the fir&#383;t who planted them in <i>England</i>.

</p>
<p>

12. Cardon, See <i>Artichaux</i>.

</p>
<p>

13. Carrots, <i>Dauci</i>, or <i>Pa&#383;tinaca Sativa</i>; temperately
warm and dry, Spicy; the be&#383;t are

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page12" name="page12"></a>[12]</span>

yellow, very nouri&#383;hing; let them be rais'd in Ground naturally
rich, but not too heavy.

</p>
<p>

14. Chervile, <i>Ch&aelig;rophyllum, Myrrhis</i>; The &#383;weet
aromatick <i>Spani&#383;h Chervile</i>, moderately hot and dry: The
tender <i>Cim&aelig;</i>, and Tops, with other Herbs, are never to be
wanting in our <i>Sallets</i>, (as long as they may be had) being
exceedingly whol&#383;ome and chearing the Spirits: The <i>Roots</i> are
al&#383;o boil'd and eaten Cold; much commended for Aged Per&#383;ons:
This (as likewi&#383;e <i>Spinach</i>) is us'd in <i>Tarts</i>, and
&#383;erves alone for divers Sauces.

of them&#383;elves, &#383;ea&#383;onably eaten with other Salleting, the

<i>Salad de Preter</i>, for their being generally eaten in <i>Lent</i>.

18. Cow&#383;lips, <i>Paraly&#383;is</i>: See <i>Flowers</i>.

<p>

19. Cre&#383;&#383;es, <i>Na&#383;turtium</i>, Garden
<i>Cre&#383;&#383;es</i>; to be monthly &#383;own: But above all the
<i>Indian</i>, moderately hot, and aromatick, quicken the torpent
Spirits, and purge the Brain, and are of &#383;ingular effect
again&#383;t the <i>Scorbute</i>. Both the tender Leaves, <i>Calices,
Cappuchin Capers</i>, and <i>Flowers</i>, are laudably mixed with the
colder Plants. The <i>Buds</i> being Candy'd, are likewi&#383;e us'd in
Strewings all Winter. There is the <i>Na&#383;tur. Hybernicum</i>
commended al&#383;o, and the vulgar <i>Water-Cre&#383;s</i>, proper in
the Spring, all of the &#383;ame Nature, tho' of different Degrees, and
best for raw and cold Stomachs, but nouri&#383;h little.

20. Cucumber, <i>Cucumis</i>; tho' very cold and moi&#383;t, the
mo&#383;t approved <i>Sallet</i> alone, or in Compo&#383;ition, of all
the <i>Vinaigrets</i>, to &#383;harpen the Appetite, and cool the Liver,

prepar'd; that is, by rectifying the vulgar Mi&#383;take of altogether
extracting the Juice, in which it &#383;hould rather be &#383;oak'd: Nor
ought it to be over <i>Oyl'd</i>, too much abating of its grateful
<i>Acidity</i>, and <i>palling</i> the Ta&#383;te from a contrariety of
Particles: Let them therefore be pared, and cut in thin Slices, with a
<i>Clove</i> or two of <i>Onion</i> to correct the Crudity, macerated in
the Juice, often turn'd and moderately drain'd. Others prepare them, by
&#383;haking the Slices between two Di&#383;hes, and dre&#383;s them
with very little <i>Oyl</i>, well beaten, and mingled with the Juice of
<i>Limon, Orange</i>, or <i>Vinegar, Salt</i> and <i>Pepper</i>. Some
again, (and indeed the mo&#383;t approv'd) eat them as &#383;oon as they
are cut, retaining their Liquor, which being exhau&#383;ted (by the
former Method) have nothing remaining in them to help the Concoction. Of
old they
<a href="#note-17" name="noteref-17" class="noteref"><sup>17</sup></a>boil'd the <i>Cucumber</i>, and paring
off the Rind, eat them with <i>Oyl, Vinegar</i>, and <i>Honey</i>;
<i>Sugar</i> not being &#383;o well known. La&#383;tly, the <i>Pulp</i>
in Broth is greatly refre&#383;hing, and may be mingl'd in mo&#383;t
<i>Sallets</i>, without the lea&#383;t damage, contrary to the common
Opinion; it not being long, &#383;ince <i>Cucumber</i>, however
dre&#383;s'd, was thought fit to be thrown away, being accounted

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page15" name="page15"></a>[15]</span>

little better than Poy&#383;on. <i>Tavernier</i> tells us, that in the
<i>Levant</i>, if a Child cry for &#383;omething to Eat, they give it a
raw <i>Cucumber</i> in&#383;tead of <i>Bread</i>. The young ones may be
boil'd in White-Wine. The &#383;maller sort (known by the name of
<i>Gerckems</i>) muriated with the Seeds of <i>Dill</i>, and the
<i>Mango</i> Pickle are for the Winter.

</p>
<p>

21. Dai&#383;y, <i>Buphthalmum</i>, Ox-Eye, or <i>Bellis-major</i>: The
young <i>Roots</i> are frequently eaten by the <i>Spaniards</i> and
<i>Italians</i> all the Spring till <i>June</i>.

</p>
<p>

22. Dandelion, <i>Dens Leonis, Condrilla</i>: Macerated in &#383;everal
Waters, to extract the bitterne&#383;s; tho' &#383;omewhat opening, is
very whol&#383;ome, and little inferior to <i>Succory, Endive</i>,
&amp;c. The <i>French</i> Country-People eat the Roots; and 'twas with
this homely <i>Sallet</i>, the Good-Wife <i>Hecate</i> entertain'd
<i>The&#383;eus</i>. See <i>Sowthi&#383;tle</i>.

</p>
<p>

23. Dock, <i>Oxylapathum</i>, or &#383;harp-pointed Dock: Emollient, and
tho' otherwi&#383;e not for our <i>Sallet</i>, the <i>Roots</i> brewed
in <i>Ale</i> or <i>Beer</i>, are excellent for the <i>Scorbute</i>.

</p>
<p>

Earth-Nuts, <i>Bulbo-Ca&#383;tanum</i>; (found in divers places of
<i>Surry</i>, near <i>King&#383;ton</i>, and other

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page16" name="page16"></a>[16]</span>

parts) the Rind par'd off, are eaten crude by Rustics, with a little
<i>Pepper</i>; but are be&#383;t boil'd like other Roots, or in Pottage
rather, and are &#383;weet and nouri&#383;hing.

</p>
<p>

24. Elder, <i>Sambucus</i>; The Flowers infus'd in <i>Vinegar</i>,
grateful both to the Stomach and Ta&#383;te; attenuate thick and
vi&#383;cid Humours; and tho' the Leaves are &#383;omewhat rank of
Smell, and &#383;o not commendable in <i>Sallet</i>; they are
otherwi&#383;e (as indeed is the intire Shrub) of the most
&#383;overeign Vertue; and the &#383;pring Buds and tender Leaves,
excellently whol&#383;ome in Pottage at that Sea&#383;on of the Year.
See <i>Flowers</i>.

</p>
<p>

25. Endive, <i>Endivium, Intubum Sativum</i>; the large&#383;t,
white&#383;t, and tendere&#383;t Leaves be&#383;t boil'd, and le&#383;s
crude. It is naturally Cold, profitable for hot Stomachs;
<i>Inci&#383;ive</i> and opening Ob&#383;tructions of the Liver: The
curled is more delicate, being eaten alone, or in Compo&#383;ition, with
the u&#383;ual <i>Intinctus</i>: It is al&#383;o excellent being boil'd;
the middle part of the Blanch'd-Stalk &#383;eparated, eats firm, and the
ampler Leaves by many perferr'd before <i>Lettuce</i>. See
<i>Succory</i>.

26. Fennel, <i>F&oelig;niculum</i>: The &#383;weete&#383;t of
<i>Bolognia</i>: Aromatick, hot, and dry; expels Wind, &#383;harpens the
Sight, and recreates the Brain; e&#383;pecially the tender
<i>Umbella</i> and Seed-Pods. The Stalks are to be peel'd when young,
and then dre&#383;s'd like <i>Sellery</i>. The tender Tufts and Leaves
emerging, being minc'd, are eaten alone with <i>Vinegar</i>, or
<i>Oyl</i>, and <i>Pepper</i>, and to correct the colder Materials,
enter properly into Compo&#383;ition. The <i>Italians</i> eat the
blanch'd Stalk (which they call <i>Cartucci</i>) all Winter long. There
is a very &#383;mall <i>Green-Worm</i>, which &#383;ometimes lodges in
the Stemm of this Plant, which is to be taken out, as the <i>Red</i> one
in that of <i>Sellery</i>.

</p>
<p>

27. Flowers, <i>Flores</i>; chiefly of the <i>Aromatick
E&#383;culents</i> and Plants are preferrable, as generally endow'd with
the Vertues of their <i>Simples</i>, in a more inten&#383;e degree; and
may therefore be eaten alone in their proper <i>Vehicles</i>, or
Compo&#383;ition with other <i>Salleting</i>, &#383;prinkl'd among them;
But give a more palatable Reli&#383;h, being Infus'd in <i>Vinegar</i>;
E&#383;pecially tho&#383;e of the <i>Clove-Gillyflower, Elder, Orange,
Cow&#383;lip, Rosemary, Arch-Angel, Sage, Na&#383;turtium Indicum</i>,
&amp;c. Some of them are Pickl'd, and divers of them make al&#383;o very
pleasant and whol&#383;ome <i>Theas</i>, as do likewi&#383;e the Wild
<i>Time, Buglo&#383;&#383;, Mint</i>, &amp;c.

28. Garlick, <i>Allium</i>; dry towards Exce&#383;s; and tho' both by
<i>Spaniards</i> and <i>Italians</i>, and the more Southern People,
familiarly eaten, with almo&#383;t every thing, and e&#383;teem'd of
such &#383;igular Vertue to help Conception, and thought a Charm
again&#383;t all Infection and Poy&#383;on (by which it has obtain'd the
Name of the <i>Country-man's Theriacle</i>) we yet think it more proper
for our Northern Ru&#383;tics, especially living in <i>Uliginous</i> and
moi&#383;t places, or &#383;uch as u&#383;e the <i>Sea</i>: Whil&#383;t
we ab&#383;olutely forbid it entrance into our <i>Salleting</i>, by
rea&#383;on of its intolerable Rankne&#383;s, and which made it &#383;o
dete&#383;ted of old; that the eating of it was (as we read) part of the
Puni&#383;hment for &#383;uch as had committed the horrid'&#383;t
Crimes. To be &#383;ure, 'tis not for Ladies Palats, nor tho&#383;e who
court them, farther than to permit a light touch on the Di&#383;h, with
a <i>Clove</i> thereof, much better &#383;upply'd by the gentler
<i>Roccombo</i>.

</p><p>

<i>Note</i>, That in <i>Spain</i> they &#383;ometimes eat it boil'd,
which taming its fiercene&#383;s, turns it into Nouri&#383;hment, or
rather <i>Medicine</i>.

</p>
<p>

Ginny-Pepper, <i>Cap&#383;icum</i>. See <i>Pepper</i>.

29. Goats-beard, <i>Trago-pogon:</i> The <i>Root</i> is excellent even
in <i>Sallet</i>, and very Nutritive,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page19" name="page19"></a>[19]</span>

exceeding profitable for the Brea&#383;t, and may be &#383;tew'd and
dre&#383;s'd as <i>Scorzonera</i>.

</p>
<p>

30. Hops, <i>Lupulus</i>: Hot and moi&#383;t, rather <i>Medicinal</i>,
than fit for <i>Sallet</i>; the <i>Buds</i> and young <i>Tendrels</i>
excepted, which may be eaten raw; but more conveniently being boil'd,
and cold like <i>A&#383;paragus</i>: They are <i>Diuretic</i>; depurate
the Blood, and open Ob&#383;tructions.

</p>
<p>

31. Hy&#383;&#383;op, <i>Hy&#383;&#383;opus; Thymus Capitatus Creticus;
Majoran, Mary-gold</i>, &amp;c. as all hot, &#383;picy <i>Aromatics</i>,
(commonly growing in <i>Kitchin-Gardens</i>) are of Faculty to Comfort,
and &#383;trengthen; prevalent again&#383;t Melancoly and Phlegm;
Plants, like the&#383;e, going under the Names of <i>Pot Herbs</i>, are
much more proper for <i>Broths</i> and <i>Decoctions</i>, than the
tender <i>Sallet</i>: Yet the <i>Tops</i> and <i>Flowers</i> reduc'd to
Powder, are by &#383;ome re&#383;erv'd for Strewings, upon the colder
Ingredients; communicating no ungrateful Fragrancy.

</p>
<p>

32. Jack-by-the-Hedge, <i>Alliaria</i>, or <i>Sauce-alone</i>; has many
Medicinal Properties, and is eaten as other <i>Sallets</i>,
e&#383;pecially by Country People, growing wild under their Banks and
Hedges.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page20" name="page20"></a>[20]</span>

33. Leeks, and <i>Cibbols, Porrum</i>; hot, and of Vertue Prolifick,
&#383;ince <i>Latona</i>, the Mother of <i>Appolo</i> long'd after them:
The <i>Welch</i>, who eat them much, are ob&#383;erv'd to be very
fruitful: They are al&#383;o friendly to the Lungs and Stomach, being
&#383;od in Milk; a few therefore of the &#383;lender and green
Summities, a little &#383;hred, do not ami&#383;s in Compo&#383;ition.
See <i>Onion</i>.

34. Lettuce, <i>Lactuca</i>: Tho' by <i>Metaphor</i> call'd <a
href="#note-18" name="noteref-18"
class="noteref"><sup>18</sup></a><i>Mortuorum Cibi</i>, (to &#383;ay

It is indeed of Nature more cold and moi&#383;t than any of the

extingui&#383;hes Thir&#383;t, excites Appetite, kindly Nouri&#383;hes,
and above all repre&#383;&#383;es Vapours, conciliates Sleep, mitigates
Pain; be&#383;ides the effect it has upon the Morals, <i>Temperance</i>
and <i>Cha&#383;tity</i>. Galen (who&#383;e beloved <i>Sallet</i> it
was) from its <i>pinguid, &#383;ubdulcid</i> and agreeable Nature,
&#383;ays it breeds the mo&#383;t laudable Blood. No marvel then that
they were by the Ancients called <i>Sana</i>, by way of eminency, and
&#383;o highly valu'd by the great
<a href="#note-20" name="noteref-20" class="noteref"><sup>20</sup></a><i>Augu&#383;tus</i>, that attributing
his Recovery of a dangerous Sickne&#383;s to them, 'tis reported, he
erected a <i>Statue</i>, and built an <i>Altar</i> to this noble Plant.
And that the mo&#383;t ab&#383;temious and excellent Emperor <a
href="#note-21" name="noteref-21"
class="noteref"><sup>21</sup></a><i>Tacitus</i> (&#383;pending
almo&#383;t nothing at his frugal Table in other Dainties) was yet
&#383;o great a Friend to <i>Lettuce</i>, that he was us'd to &#383;ay
of his Prodigality, <i>Somnum &#383;e mercari illa &#383;umptus
effu&#383;ione</i>. How it was celebrated by <i>Galen</i> we have heard;
how he us'd it he tells him&#383;elf; namely, beginning with
<i>Lettuce</i> in his younger Days, and concluding with it when he grew
old, and that to his great advantage. In a word, we meet with nothing
among all our crude Materials

and <i>Sallet</i> &#383;tore, &#383;o proper to mingle with any of the
re&#383;t, nor &#383;o whol&#383;ome to be eaten alone, or in
Compo&#383;ition, moderately, and with the u&#383;ual
<i>Oxel&oelig;um</i> of <i>Vinegar, Pepper</i>, and <i>Oyl</i>, &amp;c.
which la&#383;t does not &#383;o perfectly agree with the
<i>Alphange</i>, to which the Juice of <i>Orange</i>, or <i>Limon</i>
and <i>Sugar</i> is more de&#383;irable: <i>Ari&#383;toxenus</i> is
reported to have irrigated his <i>Lettuce</i>-Beds with an
<i>Oinomelite</i>, or mixture of <i>Wine</i> and <i>Honey</i>: And
certainly 'tis not for nothing that our Garden-Lovers, and <i>Brothers
of the Sallet</i>, have been &#383;o exceedingly Indu&#383;trious to
cultivate this Noble Plant, and multiply its <i>Species</i>; for to name
a few in pre&#383;ent u&#383;e: We have the <i>Alphange</i> of
<i>Montpelier</i>, cri&#383;p and delicate; the <i>Arabic;
Ambervelleres; Belgrade, Cabbage, Capuchin, Co&#383;s-Lettuce,
Curl'd</i>; the <i>Genoa</i> (la&#383;ting all the Winter) the
<i>Imperial, Lambs</i>, or <i>Agnine</i>, and <i>Lobbs</i> or
<i>Lop-Lettuces</i>. The <i>French Minion</i> a dwarf kind: The
<i>Oak-Leaf, Pa&#383;&#383;ion, Roman, Shell</i>, and
<i>Sile&#383;ian</i>, hard and crimp (e&#383;teemed of the be&#383;t and
rare&#383;t) with divers more: And here let it be noted, that
be&#383;ides three or four &#383;orts of this Plant, and &#383;ome few
of the re&#383;t, there was within our remembrance, rarely any other
<i>Salleting</i> &#383;erv'd up to the be&#383;t Tables; with unblanch'd
<i>Endive, Succory, Pur&#383;elan</i>, (and indeed little other

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page23" name="page23"></a>[23]</span>

variety) <i>Sugar</i> and <i>Vinegar</i> being the con&#383;tant
<i>Vehicles</i> (without <i>Oyl</i>) but now <i>Sugar</i> is almo&#383;t
wholly bani&#383;h'd from all, except the more effeminate Palates, as
too much palling, and taking from the grateful <i>Acid</i> now in
u&#383;e, tho' otherwi&#383;e not totally to be reproved: <i>Lettuce</i>
boil'd and <i>Condited</i> is &#383;ometimes &#383;poken of.

</p>
<p>

35. Limon, <i>Limonia, citrea mala</i>; exceedingly refre&#383;hing,
<i>Cordial</i>, &amp;c. The Pulp being blended with the Juice,
&#383;ecluding the over-&#383;weet or bitter. See <i>Orange</i>.

</p>
<p>

36. Mallow, <i>Malva</i>; the curl'd, emollient, and friendly to the
<i>Ventricle</i>, and &#383;o rather Medicinal; yet may the Tops, well
boil'd, be admitted, and the re&#383;t (tho' out of u&#383;e at
pre&#383;ent) was taken by the Poets for all <i>Sallets</i> in general.
<i>Pythagoras</i> held <i>Malv&aelig; folium Sancti&#383;imum</i>; and
we find <i>Epimenides</i> in
<a href="#note-22" name="noteref-22" class="noteref"><sup>22</sup></a>Plato at his <i>Mallows</i> and

37. Melon, <i>Melo</i>; to have been reckon'd rather among
<i>Fruits</i>; and tho' an u&#383;ual Ingredient in our <i>Sallet</i>;
yet for its tran&#383;cendent delicacy and flavor, cooling and
exhilarating Nature (if &#383;weet, dry, weighty, and well-fed) not only
&#383;uperior all the <i>Gourd</i>-kind, but Paragon with the
noble&#383;t Productions of the Garden. <i>Jo&#383;. Scaliger</i> and
<i>Ca&#383;aubon</i>, think our <i>Melon</i> unknown to the Ancients,
(which others contradict) as yet under the name of <i>Cucumers</i>:

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page25" name="page25"></a>[25]</span>

But he who reads how artificially they were Cultivated, rais'd under
Gla&#383;&#383;es, and expos'd to the hot Sun, (for <i>Tiberius</i>)
cannot well doubt of their being the &#383;ame with ours.

</p><p>

There is al&#383;o a <i>Winter-Melon</i>, large and with black Seeds,
exceedingly Cooling, brought us from abroad, and the hotter Climates,
where they drink <i>Water</i> after eating <i>Melons</i>; but in the
colder (after all di&#383;pute) <i>Wine</i> is judg'd the better: That
it has indeed by &#383;ome been accus'd as apt to corrupt in the Stomach
(as do all things el&#383;e eaten in exce&#383;s) is not deny'd: But a
perfect good <i>Melon</i> is certainly as harmle&#383;s a Fruit as any
what&#383;oever; and may &#383;afely be mingl'd with <i>Sallet</i>, in
Pulp or Slices, or more properly eaten by it &#383;elf, with a little
<i>Salt</i> and <i>Pepper</i>; for a <i>Melon</i> which requires
<i>Sugar</i> to commend it, wants of Perfection. <i>Note</i>, That this
Fruit was very rarely cultivated in <i>England</i>, &#383;o as to bring
it to Maturity, till Sir <i>Geo. Gardner</i> came out of <i>Spain</i>. I
my &#383;elf remembring, when an ordinary <i>Melon</i> would have been
&#383;old for five or &#383;ix Shillings. The &#383;mall unripe Fruit,
when the others are pa&#383;t, may be Pickl'd with <i>Mango</i>, and are
very delicate.

</p>
<p>

38. Mint, <i>Mentha</i>; the <i>Angu&#383;tifolia Spicata</i>,
Spear-Mint; dry and warm, very fragrant, a

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page26" name="page26"></a>[26]</span>

little pre&#383;s'd, is friendly to the weak Stomach, and powerful
again&#383;t all <i>Nervous</i> Crudities: The gentler Tops of the
<i>Orange-Mint</i>, enter well into our Compo&#383;ition, or are
grateful alone (as are al&#383;o the other &#383;orts) with the Juice of
<i>Orange</i>, and a little <i>Sugar</i>.

39. Mu&#383;hroms, <i>Fungi</i>; By the

young Plants, like tho&#383;e of <i>Radi&#383;hes</i> (newly peeping out

&#383;trengthening the Memory, expelling heavine&#383;s, preventing the

Be&#383;ides it is an approv'd <i>Anti&#383;corbutick</i>; aids

nece&#383;&#383;ary an Ingredient to all cold and raw <i>Salleting</i>,
that it is very rarely, if at all, to be left out. In <i>Italy</i> in
making <i>Mu&#383;tard</i>, they mingle <i>Limon</i> and
<i>Orange-Peel</i>, with the Seeds. How the be&#383;t is made, &#383;ee

41. Nettles, <i>Urtica</i>; Hot, dry, <i>Diuretic, Solvent</i>; purifies
the Blood: The Buds, and very tender <i>Cimae</i>, a little
brui&#383;ed, are by &#383;ome eaten raw, by others boil'd,

42. Onion, <i>Cepa</i>, <i>Porrum</i>; the be&#383;t are &#383;uch as
are brought us out of <i>Spain</i>, whence they of St. <i>Omers</i> had
them, and &#383;ome that have weigh'd eight Pounds. Choo&#383;e
therefore the large, round, white, and thin Skin'd. Being eaten crude
and alone with <i>Oyl</i>, <i>Vinegar</i>, and <i>Pepper</i>, we own
them in <i>Sallet</i>, not &#383;o hot as <i>Garlick</i>, nor at all
&#383;o rank: Boil'd, they give a kindly reli&#383;h; raise Appetite,
corroborate the Stomach, cut Phlegm, and profit the
<i>A&#383;thmatical</i>: But eaten in exce&#383;s, are &#383;aid to
offend the Head and Eyes, unle&#383;s <i>Edulcorated</i> with a gentle
maceration. In the mean time, as to their being noxious to the Sight, is
imputable only to the Vapour ri&#383;ing from the raw Onion, when
peeled, which &#383;ome commend for its purging and quickning that
Sen&#383;e. How they are us'd in Pottage, boil'd in Milk, stew'd,
&amp;c. concerns the Kitchin. In our cold <i>Sallet</i> we &#383;upply
them with the <i>Porrum Sectile</i>, Tops of <i>Leeks</i>, and
<i>E&#383;chalots</i> (<i>A&#383;calonia</i>) of gu&#383;t more exalted,
yet not to the degree of <i>Garlick</i>. Or (by what of later u&#383;e
is much preferr'd) with a <i>Seed</i> or two of <i>Raccombo</i>, of a
yet milder and delicate nature, which by rubbing the Di&#383;h only,
imparts its Vertue agreeably enough. In <i>Italy</i> they frequently
make a <i>Sallet</i> of <i>Scalions</i>, <i>Cives</i>, and
<i>Chibbols</i> only &#383;ea&#383;on'd with <i>Oyl</i> and
<i>Pepper</i>;

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page32" name="page32"></a>[32]</span>

and an hone&#383;t laborious Country-man, with good <i>Bread</i>,
<i>Salt</i>, and a little <i>Par&#383;ley</i>, will make a contented
Meal with a roa&#383;ted <i>Onion</i>. How this noble <i>Bulb</i> was
deified in
<a href="#note-37" name="noteref-37" class="noteref"><sup>37</sup></a><i>Egypt</i> we are told, and that

in this Root
<a href="#note-38" name="noteref-38" class="noteref"><sup>38</sup></a><i>Ninety Tun</i> of <i>Gold</i> among
the Workmen. So lu&#383;hious and tempting it &#383;eems they were, that
as whole Nations have &#383;ub&#383;i&#383;ted on them alone; &#383;o
the <i>I&#383;raelites</i> were ready to return to <i>Slavery</i> and
<i>Brick-making</i> for the love of them. Indeed <i>Hecamedes</i> we
find pre&#383;ents them to <i>Patroclus</i>, in <i>Homer</i>, as a
<i>Regalo</i>; But certainly we are either mi&#383;taken in the
<i>Species</i> (which &#383;ome will have to be <i>Melons</i>) or
u&#383;e <i>Poetick</i> Licence, when we &#383;o highly magnify them.

43. Orach, <i>Atriplex</i>: Is cooling, allays the <i>Pituit</i> Humor:
Being &#383;et over the Fire, neither <i>this</i>, nor <i>Lettuce</i>,
needs any other Water than their own moi&#383;ture to boil them in,
without Expre&#383;&#383;ion: The tender Leaves are mingl'd with other
cold <i>Salleting</i>; but 'tis better in Pottage. See <i>Blitum</i>.

<i>Sub acid</i>; the &#383;weet and bitter <i>Orange</i> being of no
u&#383;e in our <i>Sallet</i>. The <i>Limon</i> is &#383;omewhat more
acute, cooling and extingui&#383;hing Thir&#383;t; of all the

<!--[Greek: Oxubapha]-->

the best <i>&#383;uccedaneum</i> to <i>Vinegar</i>. The very Spoils and
Rinds of <i>Orange</i> and <i>Limon</i> being &#383;hred and
&#383;prinkl'd among the other Herbs, correct the Acrimony. But they are
the tender <i>Seedlings</i> from the <i>Hot-Bed</i>, which impart an

Vertue against all flatulency

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page34" name="page34"></a>[34]</span>

proceeding from cold and phlegmatic Con&#383;titutions, and generally
all Crudities what&#383;oever; and therefore for being of univer&#383;al
u&#383;e to correct and temper the cooler Herbs, and &#383;uch as abound
in moi&#383;ture; It is a never to be omitted Ingredient of our
<i>Sallets</i>; provided it be not too minutely beaten (as oft we find
it) to an almo&#383;t impalpable Du&#383;t, which is very pernicious and
frequently adheres and &#383;ticks in the folds of the Stomach, where,
in&#383;tead of promoting Concoction, it often cau&#383;es a
<i>Cardialgium</i>, and fires the Blood: It &#383;hould therefore be
gro&#383;ly contus'd only.

</p><p>

<i>Indian Cap&#383;icum</i>, &#383;uperlatively hot and burning, is yet
by the <i>Africans</i> eaten with <i>Salt</i> and <i>Vinegar</i> by it
&#383;elf, as an u&#383;ual Condiment; but wou'd be of dangerous
con&#383;equence with us; being &#383;o much more of an acrimonious and
terribly biting quality, which by Art and Mixture is
notwith&#383;tanding render'd not only &#383;afe, but very agreeable in
our <i>Sallet</i>.

</p><p>

Take the <i>Pods</i>, and dry them well in a Pan; and when they are
become &#383;ufficiently hard, cut them into &#383;mall pieces, and
&#383;tamp 'em in a Mortar to du&#383;t: To each Ounce of which add a
Pound of <i>Wheat-flour</i>, fermented with a little <i>Levain</i>:
Kneed and make them into Cakes or Loaves cut long-wi&#383;e, in
&#383;hape of <i>Naples-Bi&#383;cuit</i>.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page35" name="page35"></a>[35]</span>

The&#383;e Re-bake a &#383;econd time, till they are Stone-hard: Pound
them again as before, and ferce it through a fine Sieve, for a very
proper Sea&#383;oning, in&#383;tead of vulgar <i>Peper</i>. The
Mordicancy thus allay'd, be &#383;ure to make the Mortar very clean,
after having beaten <i>Indian Cap&#383;icum</i>, before you &#383;tamp
any thing in it el&#383;e. The green Husks, or fir&#383;t peeping Buds
of the <i>Walnut-Tree</i>, dry'd to Powder, &#383;erve for <i>Peper</i>
in &#383;ome places, and &#383;o do <i>Myrtle-berries</i>.

48. Per&#383;ley, <i>Petro&#383;elinum</i>, or <i>Apium
horten&#383;e</i>; being hot and dry, opens Ob&#383;tructions, is very
<i>Diuretic</i>, yet nouri&#383;hing, <i>edulcorated</i> in &#383;hifted
warm Water (the Roots e&#383;pecially) but of le&#383;s Vertue than
<i>Alexanders</i>; nor &#383;o convenient in our crude <i>Sallet</i>, as
when decocted on a Medicinal Account. Some few tops of the tender Leaves
may yet be admitted; tho' it was of old, we read, never brought to the
Table at all, as &#383;acred to <i>Oblivium</i> and the <i>Defunct</i>.
In the mean time, there being nothing more proper for Stuffing,
(<i>Farces</i>) and other <i>Sauces</i>, we con&#383;ign it to the
<i>Olitories</i>. <i>Note</i>, that Per&#383;ley is not &#383;o hurtful
to the Eyes as is reported. See <i>Sellery</i>.

</p>
<p>

49. Pimpernel, <i>Pimpinella</i>; eaten by the <i>French</i> and
<i>Italians</i>, is our common <i>Burnet</i>; of

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page36" name="page36"></a>[36]</span>

&#383;o chearing and exhilarating a quality, and &#383;o generally
commended, as (giving it admittance into all <i>Sallets</i>) 'tis
pa&#383;s'd into a Proverb: </p>

50. Purslain, <i>Portulaca</i>; e&#383;pecially the <i>Golden</i>
whil&#383;t tender, next the Seed-leaves, with the young Stalks, being
eminently moi&#383;t and cooling, quickens Appetite, a&#383;&#383;wages
Thir&#383;t, and is very profitable for hot and <i>Bilious</i> Tempers,
as well as <i>Sanguine</i>, and generally entertain'd in all our
<i>Sallets</i>, mingled with the hotter Herbs: Tis likewi&#383;e
familiarly eaten alone with <i>Oyl</i> and <i>Vinegar</i>; but with
moderation, as having been &#383;ometimes found to corrupt in the
Stomach, which being <i>Pickl'd</i> 'tis not &#383;o apt to do. Some eat
it cold, after it has been boil'd, which Dr. <i>Muffet</i> would have in
<i>Wine</i>, for Nouri&#383;hment.

The Shrub <i>Halimus</i>, is a &#383;ort of <i>Sea-Pur&#383;lain</i>:
The newly peeping Leaves (tho' rarely us'd) afford a no unplea&#383;ant

51. Radi&#383;h, <i>Raphanus</i>. Albeit rather Medicinal, than &#383;o
commendably accompanying our <i>Sallets</i> (wherein they often
&#383;lice the larger Roots) are much inferior to the young Seedling
Leaves and Roots; rai&#383;ed on the
<a href="#note-39" name="noteref-39" class="noteref"><sup>39</sup></a>Monthly
<i>Hot-Bed</i>, almo&#383;t the whole Year round, affording a very
grateful mordacity, and &#383;ufficiently attempers the cooler

&#383;uch as being tran&#383;parent, eat &#383;hort and quick, without
&#383;tringine&#383;s, and not too biting. The&#383;e are eaten alone
with <i>Salt</i> only, as carrying their <i>Peper</i> in them; and were
indeed by <i>Dio&#383;corides</i> and <i>Pliny</i> celebrated above all
Roots what&#383;oever; in&#383;omuch as in the <i>Delphic</i> Temple,
there was <i>Raphanus ex auro dicatus</i>, a Radish of &#383;olid Gold;
and 'tis &#383;aid of <i>Mo&#383;chius</i>, that he wrote a whole Volume

tells us, that as the Prince of <i>Phy&#383;icians</i> writes, It is
hard of Dige&#383;tion, <i>Inimicous</i> to the Stomach, cau&#383;ing

<i>Lettuce</i>, <i>Purcelain</i>, and the re&#383;t, &amp;c. See
<i>Tarragon</i>.

</p>
<p>

Roccombo. See <i>Onions</i>.

</p>
<p>

54. Ro&#383;emary, <i>Ro&#383;marinus</i>; Soverainly <i>Cephalic</i>,
and for the <i>Memory</i>, <i>Sight</i>, and <i>Nerves</i>,
incomparable: And tho' not us'd in the Leaf with our <i>Sallet</i>
furniture, yet the <i>Flowers</i>, a little bitter, are always welcome
in <i>Vinegar</i>; but above all, a fre&#383;h Sprig or two in a
Gla&#383;s of <i>Wine</i>. See <i>Flowers</i>.

</p>
<p>

55. Sage, <i>Salvia</i>; hot and dry. The tops of the <i>Red</i>, well
pick'd and wa&#383;h'd (being often defil'd with Venomous Slime, and
almo&#383;t imperceptible <i>In&#383;ects</i>) with the <i>Flowers</i>,
retain all

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page40" name="page40"></a>[40]</span>

the noble Properties of the other hot Plants; more e&#383;pecially for
the <i>Head</i>, <i>Memory</i>, <i>Eyes</i>, and all <i>Paralytical</i>
Affections. In &#383;hort, 'tis a Plant endu'd with &#383;o many and
wonderful Properties, as that the a&#383;&#383;iduous u&#383;e of it is
&#383;aid to render Men <i>Immortal</i>: We cannot therefore but allow
the tender <i>Summities</i> of the young Leaves; but principally the
<i>Flowers</i> in our cold <i>Sallet</i>; yet &#383;o as not to
domineer.

</p>
<p>

Sal&#383;ifax, <i>Scorzonera</i>. See <i>Vipergra&#383;s</i>.

</p>
<p>

56. Sampier, <i>Crithmum</i>: That growing on the Sea-Cliffs (as about
<i>Dover</i>, &amp;c.) not only <i>Pickl'd</i>, but crude and cold, when
young and tender (and &#383;uch as we may Cultivate, and have in our
<i>Kitchin-Gardens</i>, almo&#383;t the Year round) is in my Opinion,
for its <i>Aromatic</i>, and other excellent Vertues and Effects
again&#383;t the <i>Spleen</i>, Clean&#383;ing the Pa&#383;&#383;ages,
&#383;harpning Appetite, &amp;c. &#383;o far preferrable to mo&#383;t of
our hotter Herbs, and <i>Sallet</i>-Ingredients, that I have long
wonder'd, it has not been long &#383;ince propagated in the
<i>Potagere</i>, as it is in <i>France</i>; from whence I have often
receiv'd the Seeds, which have pro&#383;per'd better, and more kindly
with me, than what comes from our own Coa&#383;ts: It does not indeed
<i>Pickle</i> &#383;o well, as

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page41" name="page41"></a>[41]</span>

being of a more tender Stalk and Leaf: But in all other re&#383;pects
for compo&#383;ing <i>Sallets</i>, it has nothing like it.

</p>
<p>

57. Scalions, <i>A&#383;calonia</i>, <i>Cep&aelig;</i>; The
<i>French</i> call them <i>Appetites</i>, which it notably quickens and
&#383;tirs up: Corrects Crudities, and promotes Concoction. The
<i>Italians</i> &#383;teep them in Water, mince, and eat them cold with
<i>Oyl</i>, <i>Vinegar</i>, <i>Salt</i>, &amp;c.

</p>
<p>

58. Scurvy-gra&#383;s, <i>Cochlearia</i>, of the Garden, but
e&#383;pecially that of the Sea, is &#383;harp, biting, and hot; of
Nature like <i>Na&#383;turtium</i>, prevalent in the <i>Scorbute</i>. A
few of the tender Leaves may be admitted in our Compo&#383;ition. See
<i>Na&#383;turtium Indicum</i>.

</p>
<p>

59. Sellery, <i>Apium Italicum</i>, (and of the <i>Petro&#383;eline</i>
Family) was formerly a &#383;tranger with us (nor very long &#383;ince
in <i>Italy</i>) is an hot and more generous &#383;ort of <i>Macedonian
Per&#383;ley</i>, or <i>Smallage</i>. The tender Leaves of the
<i>Blancht</i> Stalk do well in our <i>Sallet</i>, as likewi&#383;e the
&#383;lices of the whiten'd Stems, which being crimp and &#383;hort,
fir&#383;t peel'd and &#383;lit long wi&#383;e, are eaten with
<i>Oyl</i>, <i>Vinegar</i>, <i>Salt</i>, and <i>Peper</i>; and for its
high and grateful Taste, is ever plac'd in the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page42" name="page42"></a>[42]</span>

middle of the <i>Grand Sallet</i>, at our Great Mens Tables, and
<i>Pr&aelig;tors</i> Fea&#383;ts, as the Grace of the whole Board.
<i>Caution</i> is to be given of a &#383;mall red <i>Worm</i>, often
lurking in the&#383;e Stalks, as does the green in <i>Fennil</i>.

</p>
<p>

Shallots. See <i>Onion</i>.

</p>
<p>

60. Skirrets, <i>Si&#383;arum</i>; hot and moi&#383;t, corroborating,
and good for the Stomach, exceedingly nouri&#383;hing, whol&#383;ome and
delicate; of all the <i>Root-kind</i>, not &#383;ubject to be Windy, and
&#383;o valued by the Emperor <i>Tiberius</i>, that he accepted them for
Tribute.

</p><p>

This excellent Root is &#383;eldom eaten raw; but being boil'd,
&#383;tew'd, roa&#383;ted under the Embers, bak'd in Pies, whole,
&#383;liced, or in pulp, is very acceptable to all Palates. 'Tis
reported they were heretofore &#383;omething bitter; See what Culture
and Education effects!

</p>
<p>

61. Sorrel, <i>Aceto&#383;a</i>: of which there are divers kinds. The
<i>French Acetocella</i>, with the round Leaf, growing plentifully in
the <i>North</i> of <i>England</i>; <i>Roman Oxalis</i>; the broad
<i>German</i>, &amp;c. but the be&#383;t is of <i>Green-Land:</i> by
nature cold, Ab&#383;ter&#383;ive, Acid, &#383;harpning Appetite,
a&#383;&#383;wages Heat, cools the Liver, &#383;trengthens the Heart;

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page43" name="page43"></a>[43]</span>

is an <i>Anti&#383;corbutic</i>, re&#383;i&#383;ting Putrefaction, and
imparting &#383;o grateful a quickne&#383;s to the re&#383;t, as
&#383;upplies the want of <i>Orange</i>, <i>Limon</i>, and other
<i>Omphacia</i>, and therefore never to be excluded. Vide
<i>Wood-Sorrel</i>.

</p>
<p>

62. Sow-thi&#383;tle, <i>Sonchus</i>; of the <i>Intybus</i>-kind.
<i>Galen</i> was us'd to eat it as <i>Lettuce</i>; exceedingly welcome
to the late <i>Morocco</i>. Amba&#383;&#383;ador and his Retinue.

</p>
<p>

63. Sparagus, <i>A&#383;paragus</i> (<i>ab A&#383;peritate</i>)
temperately hot, and moi&#383;t; <i>Cordial</i>, <i>Diuretic</i>,
ea&#383;ie of Dige&#383;tion, and next to <i>Fle&#383;h</i>, nothing
more nourishing, as <i>Sim. Sethius</i>, an excellent Phy&#383;ician
holds. They are &#383;ometimes, but very &#383;eldom, eaten raw with
<i>Oyl</i>, and <i>Vinegar</i>; but with more delicacy (the
bitterne&#383;s fir&#383;t exhau&#383;ted) being &#383;o &#383;peedily
boil'd, as not to lo&#383;e the <i>verdure</i> and agreeable
tenderne&#383;s; which is done by letting the Water boil, before you put
them in. I do not e&#383;teem the <i>Dutch</i> great and larger
&#383;ort (e&#383;pecially rais'd by the rankne&#383;s of the Beds)
&#383;o &#383;weet and agreeable, as tho&#383;e of a moderate &#383;ize.

</p>
<p>

64. Spinach, <i>Spinachia</i>: of old not us'd in <i>Sallets</i>, and
the oftner kept out the better; I

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page44" name="page44"></a>[44]</span>

&#383;peak of the <i>crude</i>: But being boil'd to a <i>Pult</i>, and
without other Water than its own moi&#383;ture, is a mo&#383;t excellent
Condiment with <i>Butter</i>, <i>Vinegar</i>, or <i>Limon</i>, for
almo&#383;t all &#383;orts of boil'd Fle&#383;h, and may accompany a
Sick Man's Diet. 'Tis <i>Laxative</i> and <i>Emollient</i>, and
therefore profitable for the Aged, and (tho' by original a
<i>Spaniard</i>) may be had at almo&#383;t any Season, and in all
places.

</p>
<p>

Stone-Crop, <i>Sedum Minus</i>. See <i>Trick-Madame</i>.

</p>
<p>


65. Succory, <i>Cichorium</i>, an <i>Intube</i>; erratic and wild, with
a narrow dark Leaf, different from the <i>Sative</i>, tho' probably by
culture only; and for being very bitter, a little <i>edulcorated</i>
with <i>Sugar</i> and <i>Vinegar</i>, is by &#383;ome eaten in the
Summer, and more grateful to the Stomach than the Palate. See
<i>Endive</i>.

</p>
<p>

66. Tansy, <i>Tanacetum</i>; hot and clean&#383;ing; but in regard of
its domineering reli&#383;h, &#383;paringly mixt with our cold
<i>Sallet</i>, and much fitter (tho' in very &#383;mall quantity) for
the Pan, being qualified with the Juices of other fre&#383;h Herbs,
<i>Spinach</i>, <i>Green Corn</i>, <i>Violet</i>,
<i>Primrose-Leaves</i>, &amp;c. at entrance of the Spring, and then

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page45" name="page45"></a>[45]</span>

fried browni&#383;h, is eaten hot with the Juice of <i>Orange</i> and
<i>Sugar</i>, as one of the mo&#383;t agreeable of all the boil'd
<i>Herbaceous</i> Di&#383;hes.

</p>
<p>

67. Tarragon, <i>Draco Herba</i>, of <i>Spani&#383;h</i> Extraction; hot
and &#383;picy: The Tops and young Shoots, like tho&#383;e of
<i>Rochet</i>, never to be &#383;ecluded our Compo&#383;ition,
e&#383;pecially where there is much <i>Lettuce</i>. 'Tis highly cordial
and friendly to the Head, Heart, Liver, correcting the weakne&#383;s of
the Ventricle, <i>&amp;c.</i>

</p>
<p>

68. Thi&#383;tle, <i>Carduus Mari&aelig;</i>; our Lady's milky or
dappl'd Thi&#383;tle, di&#383;arm'd of its Prickles, is worth
e&#383;teem: The young Stalk about <i>May</i>, being peel'd and
&#383;oak'd in Water, to extract the bitterne&#383;s, boil'd or raw, is
a very whol&#383;ome <i>Sallet</i>, eaten with <i>Oyl</i>, <i>Salt</i>,
and <i>Peper</i>; &#383;ome eat them &#383;odden in proper Broath, or
bak'd in Pies, like the <i>Artichoak</i>; but the tender Stalk boil'd or
fry'd, &#383;ome preferr; both Nouri&#383;hing and Re&#383;torative.

</p>
<p>

69. Trick-Madame, <i>Sedum minus</i>, Stone-Crop; is cooling and
moi&#383;t, grateful to the Stomach. The <i>Cimata</i> and Tops, when
young and tender, dre&#383;s'd as <i>Pur&#383;elane</i>, is a frequent
Ingredient in our cold <i>Sallet</i>.

</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page46" name="page46"></a>[46]</span>

<p>

70. Turnep, <i>Rapum</i>; moderately hot and moi&#383;t: <i>Napus</i>;
the long <i>Navet</i> is certainly the mo&#383;t delicate of them, and
best Nouri&#383;hing. <i>Pliny</i> &#383;peaks of no fewer than &#383;ix
&#383;orts, and of &#383;everal Colours; &#383;ome of which were
&#383;uspected to be artificially tinged. But with us, the yellow is
preferr'd; by others the red <i>Bohemian</i>. But of whatever kind,
being &#383;own upon the <i>Hot-bed</i>, and no bigger than
&#383;eedling <i>Radi&#383;h</i>, they do excellently in
Compo&#383;ition; as do al&#383;o the Stalks of the common
<i>Turnep</i>, when fir&#383;t beginning to Bud.

</p><p>

And here &#383;hould not be forgotten, that whol&#383;ome, as well as
agreeable &#383;ort of <i>Bread</i>, we are
<a href="#note-42" name="noteref-42" class="noteref"><sup>42</sup></a>taught to make; and
of which we have eaten at the greate&#383;t Per&#383;ons Tables, hardly
to be distingui&#383;h'd from the be&#383;t of <i>Wheat</i>.

</p><p>

Let the <i>Turneps</i> fir&#383;t be peel'd, and boil'd in Water till
&#383;oft and tender; then &#383;trongly pre&#383;&#383;ing out the
Juice, mix them together, and when dry (beaten or pounded very fine)
with their weight of Wheat-Meal, &#383;ea&#383;on it as you do other
<i>Bread</i>, and knead it up; then letting the Dough remain a little to
<i>ferment</i>, fa&#383;hion the Pa&#383;te into Loaves, and bake it
like common Bread.

</p>
<p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page47" name="page47"></a>[47]</span>

Some roa&#383;t <i>Turneps</i> in a Paper under the Embers, and eat them
with <i>Sugar</i> and <i>Butter</i>.

</p>
<p>

71. Vine, <i>Vitis</i>, the <i>Capreols</i>, <i>Tendrels</i>, and
<i>Cla&#383;pers</i> (like tho&#383;e of the <i>Hop</i>, &amp;c.)
whil&#383;t very young, have an agreeable <i>Acid</i>, which may be
eaten alone, or with other <i>Sallet</i>.

</p>
<p>

72. Viper-gra&#383;s, <i>Tragopogon</i>, <i>Scorzonera</i>,
<i>Sal&#383;ifex</i>, &amp;c. tho' Medicinal, and excellent again&#383;t
the <i>Palpitation of the Heart</i>, <i>Faintings</i>,
<i>Ob&#383;truction of the Bowels</i>, &amp;c. are be&#383;ides a very
&#383;weet and plea&#383;ant <i>Sallet</i>; being laid to &#383;oak out
the bitterne&#383;s, then peel'd, may be eaten raw, or <i>Condited</i>;
but be&#383;t of all &#383;tew'd with <i>Marrow</i>, <i>Spice</i>,
<i>Wine</i>, &amp;c. as <i>Artichoak</i>, <i>Skirrets</i>, &amp;c.
&#383;liced or whole. They likewi&#383;e may bake, fry, or boil them; a
more excellent Root there is hardly growing.

</p>
<p>

73. Wood-Sorrel, <i>Trifolium aceto&#383;um</i>, or <i>Alleluja</i>, of
the nature of other <i>Sorrels</i>.

</p>
<p>

To all which might we add &#383;undry more, formerly had in
<i>deliciis</i>, &#383;ince grown <i>ob&#383;olete</i> or quite
neglected with us: As among the noble&#383;t <i>Bulbs</i>, that of the
<i>Tulip</i>; a Root of which has been valued not to eat, but for the
<i>Flower</i> (and yet eaten by mi&#383;take) at more than an hundred

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page48" name="page48"></a>[48]</span>

Pounds. The young fre&#383;h <i>Bulbs</i> are &#383;weet and high of
ta&#383;te.

The <i>A&#383;phodil</i> or <i>Daffodil</i>; a <i>Sallet</i> &#383;o
rare in <i>He&#383;iod's</i> Days, that <i>Lobel</i> thinks it the
<i>Par&#383;nep</i>, tho' not at all like it; however it was (with the
<i>Mallow</i>) taken anciently for any <i>Edule</i>-Root.

</p><p>

The <i>Ornithogalons</i> roa&#383;ted, as they do <i>Che&#383;tnuts</i>,
are eaten by the <i>Italians</i>, the wild yellow e&#383;pecially, with
<i>Oyl</i>, <i>Vinegar</i>, and <i>Peper</i>. And &#383;o the &#383;mall
<i>tuberous</i> Roots of <i>Gramen Amygdalo&#383;um</i>; which they
al&#383;o roa&#383;t, and make an <i>Emul&#383;ion</i> of, to u&#383;e
in Broaths as a great Re&#383;torative. The <i>Oxylapathum</i>, us'd of
old; in the time of <i>Galen</i> was eaten frequently. As al&#383;o
<i>Dracontium</i>, with the Mordicant <i>Arum Theophra&#383;ti</i>,
which <i>Dodon&aelig;us</i> teaches how to Dre&#383;s. Nay, divers of
the <i>Satyrions</i>, which &#383;ome condited with <i>Sugar</i>, others
boil'd in Milk for a great Nouri&#383;her, now di&#383;carded. But what
think we of the <i>Cicuta</i>, which there are who reckon among
<i>Sallet</i> Herbs? But whatever it is in any other Country, 'tis
certainly Mortiferous in ours. To these add the <i>Viola Matronalis</i>,
<i>Radix Lunaria</i>, &amp;c. nay, the <i>Green Poppy</i>, by most
accounted among the deadly Poy&#383;ons: How cautious then ought our
<i>Sallet</i>-Gatherers to be, in reading ancient Authors; le&#383;t
they happen to be impos'd on, where they treat of

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page49" name="page49"></a>[49]</span>

Plants, that are familiarly eaten in other Countries, and among other
Nations and People of more robu&#383;t and &#383;trong
con&#383;titutions? be&#383;sides the hazard of being mi&#383;taken in
the Names of divers <i>Simples</i>, not as yet fully agreed upon among
the Learned in <i>Botany</i>.

</p><p>

There are be&#383;sides &#383;everal remaining, which tho'
<i>Abdicated</i> here with us, find Entertainment &#383;till in Foreign
Countries: As the large <i>Heliotrope</i> and Sun-flower (e're it comes
to expand, and &#383;hew its golden Face) which being dre&#383;s'd as
the <i>Artichoak</i>, is eaten for a dainty. This I add as a new
Di&#383;covery. I once made <i>Macaroons</i> with the ripe blanch'd
Seeds, but the <i>Turpentine</i> did &#383;o domineer over all, that it
did not an&#383;wer expectation. The <i>Radix Per&#383;onata</i>
mounting with their young Heads, <i>Ly&#383;imachia &#383;iliquo&#383;a
glabra minor</i>, when fre&#383;h and tender, begins to come into the
<i>Sallet</i>-Tribe. The pale whiter <i>Popy</i>, is eaten by the
<i>Genoue&#383;e</i>. By the <i>Spaniards</i>, the tops of
<i>Wormwood</i> with <i>Oyl</i> alone, and without &#383;o much as
<i>Bread</i>; profitable indeed to the Stomach, but offen&#383;ive to
the Head; As is al&#383;o <i>Coriander</i> and <i>Rue</i>, which
<i>Galen</i> was accu&#383;tom'd to eat raw, and by it &#383;elf, with
<i>Oyl</i> and <i>Salt</i>, as exceedingly grateful, as well as
whol&#383;ome, and of great vertue again&#383;t Infection. <i>Pliny</i>,
I remember, reports it to be

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page50" name="page50"></a>[50]</span>

of &#383;uch effect for the Pre&#383;ervation of <i>Sight</i>; that the
<i>Painters</i> of his Time, us'd to devour a great quantity of it. And
it is &#383;till by the <i>Italians</i> frequently mingled among their
<i>Sallets</i>. The <i>Lapatha Per&#383;onata</i> (common
<i>Burdock</i>) comes now and then to the be&#383;t Tables, about
<i>April</i>, and when young, before the <i>Burrs</i> and <i>Clots</i>
appear, being &#383;trip'd, and the bitterne&#383;s &#383;oaked out,
treated as the <i>Chardoon</i>, is eaten in <i>Poiverade</i>; Some
al&#383;o boil them. More might here be reckon'd up, but the&#383;e may
&#383;uffice; &#383;ince as we find &#383;ome are left off, and gone
out, &#383;o others be introduc'd and come in their room, and that in
much greater Plenty and Variety, than was ever known by our Ancestors.
The <i>Cucumber</i> it &#383;elf, now &#383;o univer&#383;ally eaten,
being accounted little better than <i>Poy&#383;on</i>, even within our
Memory, as already noted.

</p><p>

To conclude, and after all that has been &#383;aid of Plants and
<i>Salleting</i>, formerly in great e&#383;teem, (but &#383;ince
ob&#383;olete and quite rejected); What if the exalted Juice of the
ancient <i>Silphium</i> &#383;hould come in, and challenge the
Precedency? It is a
<a href="#note-43" name="noteref-43" class="noteref"><sup>43</sup></a>Plant formerly &#383;o highly priz'd,
and rare for the richne&#383;s of its Ta&#383;te and other

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page51" name="page51"></a>[51]</span>

Vertues; that as it was dedicated to <i>Apollo</i>, and hung up in his
Temple at <i>Delphi</i>; So we read of one &#383;ingle Root brought to
the Emperor <i>Nero</i> for an extraordinary Pre&#383;ent; and the Drug
&#383;o e&#383;teem'd, that the <i>Romans</i> had long before
ama&#383;s'd a quantity of it, and kept it in the Trea&#383;ury, till
<i>Julius C&aelig;&#383;ar</i> rob'd it, and took this away, as a thing
of mighty value: In a word, it was of that Account; that as a
&#383;acred Plant, tho&#383;e of the <i>Cyrenaic Africa</i>, honour'd
the very Figure of it, by &#383;tamping it on the Rever&#383;e of their

<a href="#note-44" name="noteref-44" class="noteref"><sup>44</sup></a>Coin; and when they would commend a
thing for its worth to the Skies,

<span class="Greek" title="Bat-ou silphion">
&Beta;&alpha;&tau;-&omicron;&upsilon;
&sigma;&iota;&lambda;&phi;&iota;&omicron;&nu;</span>,
<!--[Greek: Bat-ou silphion]-->

grew into a Proverb: <i>Battus</i> having been the Founder of the City
<i>Cyrene</i>, near which it only grew. 'Tis indeed conte&#383;ted among
the Learned <i>Botano&#383;ophi&#383;ts</i>, whether this Plant was not
the &#383;ame with <i>La&#383;erpitium</i>, and the La&#383;er it
yields, the odoriferous
<a href="#note-45" name="noteref-45" class="noteref"><sup>45</sup></a><i>Benzoin</i>? But doubtle&#383;s had
we the true and genuine <i>Silphium</i> (for it appears to have been
often &#383;ophi&#383;ticated, and a &#383;purious &#383;ort brought
into <i>Italy</i>) it would &#383;oon recover its

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page52" name="page52"></a>[52]</span>

pri&#383;tine Reputation, and that it was not celebrated &#383;o for
nothing extraordinary; &#383;ince be&#383;sides its Medicinal Vertue; it
was a wonderful Corroborater of the Stomach, a Re&#383;torer of
lo&#383;t Appetite, and Ma&#383;culine Vigour, <i>&amp;c.</i> and that
they made u&#383;e of it almo&#383;t in every thing they eat.

</p><p>

But &#383;hould we now really tell the World, that this precious Juice
is, by many, thought to be no other than the
<a href="#note-46" name="noteref-46" class="noteref"><sup>46</sup></a><i>Faetid
A&#383;&#383;a</i> our nicer <i>Sallet-Eaters</i> (who yet be&#383;tow
as odious an Epithet on the vulgar <i>Garlick</i>) would cry out upon it
as intolerable, and perhaps hardly believe it: But as
<i>Ari&#383;tophanes</i> has brought it in, and &#383;ufficiently
de&#383;crib'd it; &#383;o the <i>Scholia&#383;t</i> upon the place,
puts it out of Controver&#383;y: And that they made u&#383;e both of the
<i>Leaves</i>, <i>Stalk</i>, (and <i>Extract</i> e&#383;pecially) as we
now do <i>Garlick</i>, and other <i>Hautgouts</i> as nau&#383;eous
altogether. In the mean time, <i>Garcius</i>, <i>Bontius</i>, and
others, a&#383;&#383;ure us, that the <i>Indians</i> at this day
univer&#383;ally &#383;auce their Viands with it; and the <i>Bramins</i>
(who eat no Fle&#383;h at all) inrich their

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page53" name="page53"></a>[53]</span>

<i>Sallets</i>, by constantly rubbing the Di&#383;hes with it. Nor are
&#383;ome of our own &#383;kilful <i>Cooks</i> Ingnorant, how to condite
and u&#383;e it, with the Applau&#383;e of tho&#383;e, who, ignorant of
the Secret, have admir'd the richne&#383;s of the Gu&#383;t it has
imparted, when it has been &#383;ub&#383;tituted in&#383;tead of all our
<i>Cipollati</i>, and other &#383;ea&#383;onings of that Nature.

</p><p>

And thus have we done with the various <i>Species</i> of all &#383;uch
<i>E&#383;culents</i> as may properly enter the Compo&#383;ition of our
<i>Acetaria</i>, and cold <i>Sallet</i>. And if I have briefly touch'd
upon their Natures, Degrees, and <i>primary Qualities</i>, which
<i>Intend</i> or <i>Remit</i>, as to the Scale of <i>Heat</i>,
<i>Cold</i>, <i>Drine&#383;s</i>, <i>Moi&#383;ture</i>, &amp;c. (which
is to be under&#383;tood according to the different Texture of their

nece&#383;&#383;ary for the In&#383;truction of the <i>Gatherer</i>, and

What Care and Circum&#383;pection &#383;hould attend the choice and
collection of <i>Sallet</i> Herbs, has been partly &#383;hew'd. I can
therefore, by no means, approve of that extravagant Fancy of &#383;ome,
who tell us, that a <i>Fool</i> is as fit to be the <i>Gatherer</i> of a
<i>Sallet</i> as a <i>Wi&#383;er</i> Man. Becau&#383;e, &#383;ay they,
one can hardly choo&#383;e ami&#383;s, provided

the Plants be green, young, and tender, where-ever they meet with them:
But &#383;ad experience &#383;hews, how many fatal Mi&#383;takes have
been committed by tho&#383;e who took the deadly <i>Cicut&aelig;</i>,
<i>Hemlocks</i>, <i>Aconits</i>, &amp;c. for Garden <i>Per&#383;ley</i>,
and <i>Par&#383;neps</i>; the <i>Myrrhis Sylve&#383;tris</i>, or
<i>Cow-Weed</i>, for <i>Chaerophilum</i>, (<i>Chervil</i>)
<i>Thap&#383;ia</i> for <i>Fennel</i>; the wild <i>Chondrilla</i> for

who have eaten of them unwittingly: But &#383;uppo&#383;ing &#383;ome of
tho&#383;e wild and unknown Plants &#383;hould not prove &#383;o

weaken the <i>Eyes</i>, offend the <i>Stomach</i>, affect the

malignity in dangerous and dreadful <i>Symptoms</i>. And therefore
&#383;uch <i>Plants</i> as are rather <i>Medicinal</i> than
<i>Nouri&#383;hing</i> and <i>Refre&#383;hing</i>, are
&#383;tudiou&#383;ly to be rejected. So highly nece&#383;&#383;ary it
is, that what we &#383;ometimes find in <i>old Books</i> concerning

Preparation, or Mixture at all. Care therefore mu&#383;t be taken by the
<i>Collector</i>, that what he gathers an&#383;wer to the&#383;e
Qualities; and that as near as he can, they con&#383;i&#383;t (I
&#383;peak of the <i>cruder Salleting</i>) of the <i>Olu&#383;cula</i>,

<i>Phea&#383;ants</i>, and other Upland Fowl, where we have a natural
<i>Sallet</i>, pick'd, and almo&#383;t dre&#383;s'd to our hands.

</p>
<p>

I. Preparatory to the Dre&#383;&#383;ing therefore, let your Herby
Ingredients be exqui&#383;itely cull'd,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page63" name="page63"></a>[63]</span>

and cleans'd of all worm-eaten, &#383;limy, canker'd, dry, &#383;potted,
or any ways vitiated Leaves. And then that they be rather
di&#383;creetly &#383;prinkl'd, than over-much &#383;ob'd with
Spring-Water, e&#383;pecially <i>Lettuce</i>, which Dr. <a
href="#note-57" name="noteref-57"
class="noteref"><sup>57</sup></a><i>Muffet</i> thinks impairs their
Vertue; but this, I &#383;uppo&#383;e he means of the
<i>Cabbage</i>-kind, who&#383;e heads are &#383;ufficiently protected by
the outer Leaves which cover it. After wa&#383;hing, let them remain a
while in the <i>Cullender</i>, to drain the &#383;uperfluous
moi&#383;ture: And la&#383;tly, &#383;wing them altogether gently in a
clean cour&#383;e Napkin; and &#383;o they will be in perfect condition
to receive the <i>Intinctus</i> following.

</p>
<p>

II. That the <i>Oyl</i>, an Ingredient &#383;o indi&#383;pen&#383;ibly
and highly nece&#383;&#383;ary, as to have obtain'd the name of
<i>Cibarium</i> (and with us of <i>Sallet-Oyl</i>) be very clean, not
high-colour'd, nor yellow; but with an Eye rather of a pallid
<i>Olive</i> green, without Smell, or the lea&#383;t touch of
<i>rancid</i>, or indeed of any other &#383;ensible Ta&#383;te or Scent
at all; but &#383;mooth, light, and plea&#383;ant upon the Tongue;
&#383;uch as the genuine <i>Omphacine</i>, and native <i>Luca Olives</i>
afford, fit to allay the tartne&#383;s of <i>Vinegar</i>, and other
<i>Acids</i>, yet

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page64" name="page64"></a>[64]</span>

gently to warm and humectate where it pa&#383;&#383;es. Some who have an
aver&#383;ion to <i>Oyl</i>, &#383;ub&#383;titute fre&#383;h
<i>Butter</i> in its &#383;tead; but 'tis &#383;o exceedingly clogging
to the Stomach, as by no means to be allow'd.

</p>
<p>

III. <i>Thirdly</i>, That the <i>Vinegar</i> and other liquid
<i>Acids</i>, perfectly clear, neither &#383;owre, <i>Vapid</i> or
&#383;pent; be of the be&#383;t Wine Vinegar, whether Di&#383;till'd, or
otherwi&#383;e <i>Aromatiz'd</i>, and impregnated with the Infu&#383;ion
of <i>Clove-gillyflowers</i>, <i>Elder</i>, <i>Ro&#383;es</i>,
<i>Ro&#383;emary</i>, <i>Na&#383;turtium</i>, &amp;c. inrich'd with the
Vertues of the Plant.

</p><p>

A <i>Verjuice</i> not unfit for <i>Sallet</i>, is made by a <i>Grape</i>
of that Name, or the green immature Clu&#383;ters of mo&#383;t other
Grapes, pre&#383;s'd and put into a &#383;mall Ve&#383;&#383;el to
ferment.

</p>
<p>

IV. <i>Fourthly</i>, That the <i>Salt</i> (<i>aliorum Condimentorum
Condimentum</i>, as <i>Plutarch</i> calls it) deter&#383;ive,
penetrating, quickning (and &#383;o great a re&#383;i&#383;ter of

merited Divine Epithets) be of the brighte&#383;t <i>Bay grey-Salt</i>;
moderately dried, and <i>contus'd</i>, as being the lea&#383;t
Corro&#383;ive: But of this, as of <i>Sugar</i> al&#383;o, which
&#383;ome mingle with the <i>Salt</i> (as warming without heating) if

perfectly refin'd, there would be no great difficulty; provided none,
&#383;ave Ladies, were of the Me&#383;s; whil&#383;t the perfection of
<i>Sallets</i>, and that which gives them the name, con&#383;i&#383;ts
in the grateful <i>Saline Acid</i>-point, temper'd as is directed, and
which we find to be mo&#383;t e&#383;teem'd by judicious Palates: Some,
in the mean time, have been &#383;o nice, and luxuriou&#383;ly curious
as for the heightning, and (as they affect to &#383;peak) giving the
utmo&#383;t <i>poinant</i> and <i>Relev&egrave;e</i> in lieu of our
vulgar <i>Salt</i>, to recommend and cry-up the
<i>E&#383;&#383;ential-Salts</i> and <i>Spirits</i> of the mo&#383;t
Sanative Vegetables; or &#383;uch of the <i>Alcalizate</i> and
<i>Fixt</i>; extracted from the <i>Calcination</i> of <i>Baulm</i>,
<i>Ro&#383;emary</i>, <i>Wormwood</i>, <i>Scurvy-gra&#383;s</i>, &amp;c.
Affirming that without the gro&#383;s Plant, we might have healing,
cooling, generous, and refre&#383;hing <i>Cordials</i>, and all the
<i>Materia Medica</i> out of the <i>Salt-Cellar</i> only: But to
&#383;ay no more of this Impertinence, as to <i>Salts</i> of
<i>Vegetables</i>; many indeed there be, who reckon them not much unlike
in Operation, however different in <i>Ta&#383;te</i>,
<i>Cry&#383;tals</i>, and <i>Figure</i>: It being a que&#383;tion,
whether they at all retain the Vertues and Faculties of their
<i>Simples</i>, unle&#383;s they could be made without
<i>Colcination</i>. <i>Franci&#383;cus Redi</i>, gives us his Opinion of
this, in a <i>Proce&#383;s</i> how they are to be prepar'd; and &#383;o
does our

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page66" name="page66"></a>[66]</span>

Learned
<a href="#note-58" name="noteref-58" class="noteref"><sup>58</sup></a>Doctor (whom we lately nam'd) whether
<i>Lixivial</i>, <i>E&#383;&#383;ential</i>, <i>Marine</i>, or other
factitious <i>Salts</i> of Plants, with their Qualities, and how they
differ: But &#383;ince 'tis thought all <i>Fixed Salts</i> made the
<i>common way</i>, are little better than our <i>common Salt</i>, let it
&#383;uffice, that our <i>Sallet-Salt</i> be of the be&#383;t ordinary
<i>Bay-Salt</i>, clean, bright, dry, and without clamine&#383;s.

</p><p>

Of <i>Sugar</i> (by &#383;ome call'd <i>Indian-Salt</i>) as it is rarely
us'd in <i>Sallet</i>, it &#383;hould be of the be&#383;t refined,
white, hard, clo&#383;e, yet light and &#383;weet as the
<i>Madera's</i>: Nouri&#383;hing, pre&#383;erving, clean&#383;ing,
delighting the Ta&#383;te, and preferrable to <i>Honey</i> for mo&#383;t
u&#383;es. <i>Note</i>, That both <i>this</i>, <i>Salt</i>, and
<i>Vinegar</i>, are to be proportion'd to the Con&#383;titution, as well
as what is &#383;aid of the Plants them&#383;elves. The one for cold,
the other for hot stomachs.

</p>
<p>

V. That the <i>Mu&#383;tard</i> (another noble Ingredient) be of the
be&#383;t <i>Tewksberry</i>; or el&#383;e compos'd of the &#383;oundest
and weightie&#383;t <i>York&#383;hire Seed</i>, exqui&#383;itely
&#383;ifted, winnow'd, and freed from the Husks, a little (not
over-much) dry'd by the Fire, temper'd to the con&#383;i&#383;tence of a

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page67" name="page67"></a>[67]</span>

Pap with <i>Vinegar</i>, in which &#383;havings of the
<i>Hor&#383;e-Radi&#383;h</i> have been &#383;teep'd: Then cutting an
<i>Onion</i>, and putting it into a &#383;mall Earthen <i>Gally-Pot</i>,
or &#383;ome thick <i>Gla&#383;s</i> of that &#383;hape; pour the
<i>Mu&#383;tard</i> over it, and clo&#383;e it very well with a
<i>Cork</i>. There be, who pre&#383;erve the Flower and Du&#383;t of the
brui&#383;ed Seed in a well-&#383;topp'd Gla&#383;s, to temper, and have
it fre&#383;h when they plea&#383;e. But what is yet by &#383;ome
e&#383;teem'd beyond all the&#383;e, is compos'd of the dried Seeds of
the <i>Indian Na&#383;turtium</i>, reduc'd to Powder, finely bolted, and
mixt with a little <i>Levain</i>, and &#383;o from time to time made
fre&#383;h, as indeed all other <i>Mu&#383;tard</i> &#383;hould be.

</p><p>

<i>Note</i>, That the Seeds are pounded in a Mortar; or bruis'd with a
poli&#383;h'd <i>Cannon-Bullet</i>, in a large wooden Bowl-Di&#383;h, or
which is mo&#383;t preferr'd, ground in a <i>Quern</i> contriv'd for
this purpo&#383;e only.

</p>
<p>

VI. <i>Sixthly</i>, That the <i>Pepper</i> (white or black) be not
bruis'd to too &#383;mall a Du&#383;t; which, as we caution'd, is very
prejudicial. And here let me mention the <i>Root</i> of the <i>Minor
Pimpinella</i>, or &#383;mall <i>Burnet Saxifrage</i>; which being
dried, is by &#383;ome extoll'd beyond all other <i>Peppers</i>, and
more whol&#383;om.

</p><p>

Of other <i>Strewings</i> and <i>Aromatizers</i>, which

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page68" name="page68"></a>[68]</span>

may likewi&#383;e be admitted to inrich our <i>Sallet</i>, we have
already &#383;poken, where we mention <i>Orange</i> and
<i>Limon-peel</i>; to which may al&#383;o be added,
<i>Jamaica-Pepper</i>, <i>Juniper-berries</i>, &amp;c. as of
&#383;ingular Vertue.

</p><p>

Nor here &#383;hould I omit (the mentioning at lea&#383;t of)
<i>Saffron</i>, which the <i>German</i> Hou&#383;ewives have a
<i>way</i> of forming into Balls, by mingling it with a little
<i>Honey</i>; which throughly dried, they reduce to Powder, and
&#383;prinkle it over their <i>Sallets</i> for a noble <i>Cordial</i>.
Tho&#383;e of <i>Spain</i> and <i>Italy</i>, we know, generally make
u&#383;e of this Flower, mingling its golden Tincture with almo&#383;t
every thing they eat; But its being &#383;o apt to prevail above every
thing with which 'tis blended, we little incourage its admittance into
our <i>Sallet</i>.

</p>
<p>

VII. Seventhly, That there be the Yolks of fre&#383;h and new-laid
<i>Eggs</i>, boil'd moderately hard, to be mingl'd and ma&#383;h'd with
the <i>Mu&#383;tard</i>, <i>Oyl</i>, and <i>Vinegar</i>; and part to cut
into quarters, and eat with the Herbs.

</p>
<p>

VIII. <i>Eighthly</i>, (according to the <i>&#383;uper</i>-curious) that
the <i>Knife</i>, with which the <i>Sallet Herbs</i> are cut
(e&#383;pecially <i>Oranges</i>, <i>Limons</i>, &amp;c.) be of
<i>Silver</i>, and by no means of <i>Steel</i>, which

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page69" name="page69"></a>[69]</span>

all <i>Acids</i> are apt to corrode, and retain a Metalic reli&#383;h
of.

</p>
<p>

IX. <i>Ninthly</i> and <i>La&#383;tly</i>, That the <i>Saladiere</i>,
(Sallet-Di&#383;hes) be of <i>Porcelane</i>, or of the
<i>Holland-Delft-Ware</i>; neither too deep nor &#383;hallow, according
to the quantity of the <i>Sallet</i> Ingredients; <i>Pewter</i>, or even
<i>Silver</i>, not at all &#383;o well agreeing with <i>Oyl</i> and
<i>Vinegar</i>, which leave their &#383;everal Tinctures. And note, That
there ought to be one of the Di&#383;hes, in which to beat and mingle
the Liquid <i>Vehicles</i>; and a &#383;econd to receive the crude Herbs
in, upon which they are to be pour'd; and then with a Fork and a Spoon
kept continually &#383;tirr'd, 'till all the Furniture be equally
moi&#383;ten'd: Some, who are hu&#383;bands of their <i>Oyl</i>, pour at
fir&#383;t the <i>Oyl</i> alone, as more apt to communicate and
diffu&#383;e its Slipperine&#383;s, than when it is mingled and beaten
with the <i>Acids</i>; which they pour on la&#383;t of all; and 'tis
incredible how &#383;mall a quantity of <i>Oyl</i> (in this quality,
like the gilding of <i>Wyer</i>) is &#383;ufficient, to imbue a very
plentiful a&#383;&#383;embly of <i>Sallet-Herbs</i>.

</p><p>

The <i>Sallet-Gatherer</i> likewi&#383;e &#383;hould be provided with a
light, and neatly made <i>Withy-Dutch-Basket</i>, divided into
&#383;everal Partitions.

Thus in&#383;tructed and knowing in the <i>Apparatus</i>;

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page70" name="page70"></a>[70]</span>

the <i>Species</i>, <i>Proportions</i>, and manner of
<i>Dre&#383;&#383;ing</i>, according to the &#383;everal Sea&#383;ons
you have in the following Table.

</p><p>

It being one of the Inquiries of the Noble
<a href="#note-59" name="noteref-59" class="noteref"><sup>59</sup></a>Mr. <i>Boyle</i>,
what <i>Herbs</i> were proper and fit to make <i>Sallets</i> with, and
how be&#383;t to order them? we have here (by the
A&#383;&#383;i&#383;tance of Mr. <i>London</i>, His Maje&#383;ty's
Principal Gard'ner) reduc'd them to a competent Number, not exceeding
<i>Thirty Five</i>; but which may be vary'd and inlarg'd, by taking in,
or leaving out, any other <i>Sallet</i>-Plant, mention'd in the
foregoing Li&#383;t, under the&#383;e three or four Heads.

</p><p>

But all the&#383;e &#383;orts are not to be had at the very &#383;ame
time, and therefore we have divided them into the <i>Quarterly
Sea&#383;ons</i>, each containing and la&#383;ting Three Months.

</p><p>

<i>Note</i>, That by <i>Parts</i> is to be under&#383;tood a
<i>Pugil</i>; which is no more than one does u&#383;ually take up
between the Thumb and the two next Fingers. By <i>Fa&#383;cicule</i> a
rea&#383;onable full Grip, or Handful.

a</i> Sallet.

<hr class="full" />

<p style="text-indent: 0;">
<span class="dropcap">A</span>
<span class="smallcap" style="margin-left: -.75em;">nd</span>
<i>Fir&#383;t</i>, as to the <i>Sea&#383;on</i> both <i>Plants</i> and
<i>Roots</i> are then properly to be <i>Gather'd</i>, and in prime, when
mo&#383;t they abound with Juice and in Vigour: Some in the
<i>Spring</i>, or a little anticipating it before they
Blo&#383;&#383;om, or are in full Flower: Some in the <i>Autumnal</i>
Months; which later Sea&#383;on many prefer, the Sap of the Herb, tho'
not in &#383;uch exuberance, yet as being then better concocted, and
&#383;o render'd fit for <i>Salleting</i>, 'till the Spring begins a
fre&#383;h to put forth new, and tender Shoots and Leaves.

</p><p>

This, indeed, as to the <i>Root</i>, newly taken out of the Ground is
true; and therefore &#383;hould &#383;uch have their <i>Germination</i>
&#383;topt the &#383;ooner: The approaching and prevailing Cold, both
Maturing and Impregnating them; as does Heat the contrary, which now
would but exhau&#383;t them: But for tho&#383;e other
<i>E&#383;culents</i> and Herbs imploy'd in our <i>Compo&#383;ition</i>
of <i>Sallets</i>,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page72" name="page72"></a>[72]</span>

the early <i>Spring</i>, and en&#383;uing Months (till they begin to
mount, and prepare to <i>Seed</i>) is certainly the mo&#383;t natural,
and kindly Sea&#383;on to collect and accommodate them for the Table.
Let none then con&#383;ult <i>Culpeper</i>, or the
<i>Figure-flingers</i>, to inform them when the governing <i>Planet</i>
is in its <i>Exaltation</i>; but look upon the <i>Plants</i>
them&#383;elves, and judge of their Vertues by their own Complexions.

</p><p>

Moreover, in <i>Gathering</i>, Re&#383;pect is to be had to their
Proportions, as provided for in the <i>Table</i> under that Head, be the
Quality what&#383;oever: For tho' there is indeed nothing more
whol&#383;ome than <i>Lettuce</i> and <i>Mu&#383;tard</i> for the
<i>Head</i> and <i>Eyes</i>; yet either of them eaten in exce&#383;s,
were highly prejudicial to them both: Too much of the <i>fir&#383;t</i>
extreamly debilitating and weakning the <i>Ventricle</i>, and
ha&#383;tning the further decay of &#383;ickly <i>Teeth</i>; and of the
<i>&#383;econd</i> the <i>Optic Nerves</i>, and <i>Sight</i> it
&#383;elf; the like may be &#383;aid of all the re&#383;t. I conceive
therefore, a Prudent Per&#383;on, well acquainted with the Nature and
Properties of <i>Sallet-Herbs</i>, &amp;c. to be both the fitte&#383;t
<i>Gatherer</i> and <i>Compo&#383;er</i> too; which yet will require no
great Cunning, after once he is acquainted with our <i>Table</i> and
<i>Catalogue</i>.

</p><p>

We purpo&#383;ely, and <i>in tran&#383;itu</i> only, take notice here of
the Pickl'd, <i>Muriated</i>, or otherwi&#383;e

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page73" name="page73"></a>[73]</span>

prepared Herbs; excepting &#383;ome &#383;uch Plants, and Proportions of
them, as are of hard dige&#383;tion, and not fit to be eaten altogether
<i>Crude</i>, (of which in the <i>Appendix</i>) and among which I reckon
<i>A&#383;h-keys</i>, <i>Broom-buds</i> and <i>Pods</i>, <i>Haricos</i>,
<i>Gurkems</i>, <i>Olives</i>, <i>Capers</i>, the Buds and Seeds of
<i>Na&#383;turtia</i>, <i>Young Wall-nuts</i>, <i>Pine-apples</i>,
<i>Eringo</i>, <i>Cherries</i>, <i>Cornelians</i>, <i>Berberries</i>,
<i>&amp;c.</i> together with &#383;everal Stalks, Roots, and Fruits;
Ordinary Pot-herbs, <i>Anis</i>, <i>Ci&#383;tus Hortorum</i>,
<i>Horminum</i>, <i>Pulegium</i>, <i>Satureia</i>, <i>Thyme</i>; the
intire Family of Pul&#383;e and <i>Legumena</i>; or other <i>Sauces</i>,
<i>Pies</i>, <i>Tarts</i>, <i>Omlets</i>, <i>Tan&#383;ie</i>,
<i>Farces</i>, &amp;c. <i>Condites</i> and Pre&#383;erves with
<i>Sugar</i> by the Hand of Ladies; tho' they are all of them the
genuine Production of the <i>Garden</i>, and mention'd in our
<i>Kalendar</i>, together with their Culture; whil&#383;t we confine our
&#383;elves to &#383;uch Plants and <i>E&#383;culenta</i> as we find at
hand; delight our &#383;elves to gather, and are ea&#383;ily prepar'd
for an <i>Extemporary Collation</i>, or to U&#383;her in, and Accompany
other (more Solid, tho' haply not more Agreeable) Di&#383;hes, as the
Cu&#383;tom is.

</p><p>

But there now &#383;tarts up a Que&#383;tion, Whether it were better, or
more proper, to <i>Begin</i> with <i>Sallets</i>, or End and Conclude
with them? Some think the harder Meats &#383;hould fir&#383;t be eaten
for

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page74" name="page74"></a>[74]</span>

better Concoction; others, tho&#383;e of ea&#383;iest Dige&#383;tion, to
make way, and prevent Ob&#383;truction; and this makes for our
<i>Sallets</i>, <i>Horarii</i>, and <i>Fugaces Fructus</i> (as they call
'em) to be eaten fir&#383;t of all, as agreeable to the general Opinion
of the great <i>Hippocrates</i>, and <i>Galen</i>, and of
<i>Cel&#383;us</i> before him. And therefore the <i>French</i> do well,
to begin with their <i>Herbaceous Pottage</i>, and for the
<i>Cruder</i>, a Reason is given:

<i>Hor&#383;e-Radi&#383;h</i> be left out; and therefore we only mention
them in the Dre&#383;&#383;ing, which &#383;hould be in this manner.

Your <i>Herbs</i> being hand&#383;omely parcell'd, and &#383;pread on a
clean Napkin before you, are to be mingl'd together in one of the
Earthen glaz'd Di&#383;hes: Then, for the <i>Oxoleon</i>; Take of clear,
and perfectly good <i>Oyl-Olive</i>, three Parts; of &#383;harpe&#383;t

little <i>Salt</i>; Some in a &#383;eparate <i>Vinegar</i>, gently
brui&#383;e a <i>Pod</i> of <i>Guinny-Pepper</i>, &#383;training both
the <i>Vinegars</i> apart, to make U&#383;e of Either, or One alone, or
of both, as they be&#383;t like; then add as much <i>Tewkesbury</i>, or
other dry <i>Mu&#383;tard</i> grated, as will lie upon an Half-Crown
Piece: Beat, and mingle all the&#383;e very well together; but pour not
on the <i>Oyl</i> and <i>Vinegar</i>, 'till immediately before the
<i>Sallet</i> is ready to be eaten: And then with the <i>Yolk</i> of two
new-laid <i>Eggs</i> (boyl'd and prepar'd, as before is taught)
&#383;qua&#383;h, and brui&#383;e them all into ma&#383;h with a Spoon;
and la&#383;tly, pour it all upon the <i>Herbs</i>, &#383;tirring, and
mingling them 'till they are well and throughly imbib'd; not forgetting
the Sprinklings of <i>Aromaticks</i>, and &#383;uch Flowers, as we have
already mentioned, if you think fit, and garni&#383;hing the Di&#383;h
with the thin Slices of <i>Hor&#383;e-Radi&#383;h</i>, <i>Red Beet</i>,

The&#383;e <i>Rules</i>, and <i>Pre&#383;criptions</i> duly

<span class="smallcap">And</span> now after all we have advanc'd in
favour of the <i>Herbaceous</i> Diet, there &#383;till emerges a third
Inquiry; namely, Whether the U&#383;e of <i>Crude Herbs</i> and
<i>Plants</i> are &#383;o whole&#383;om as is pretended?

</p><p>

What Opinion the Prince of Phy&#383;icians had of them, we &#383;hall
&#383;ee hereafter; as al&#383;o what the Sacred Records of elder Times
&#383;eem to infer, before there were any Fle&#383;h-Shambles in the
World; together with the Reports of &#383;uch as are often
conver&#383;ant among many Nations and People, who to this Day, living
on <i>Herbs</i> and <i>Roots</i>, arrive to incredible Age, in
con&#383;tant Health and Vigour: Which, whether attributable to the
<i>Air</i> and <i>Climate</i>, <i>Cu&#383;tom</i>,
<i>Con&#383;titution</i>, &amp;c. &#383;hould be inquir'd into;
e&#383;pecially, when we compare the <i>Antediluvians</i> mention'd
<i>Gen.</i> 1. 29--the whole <i>Fifth</i> and <i>Ninth</i> Chapters,
<i>ver.</i> 3. confining them to <i>Fruit</i> and whole&#383;om Sallets:
I deny not that both the <i>Air</i> and <i>Earth</i> might then be
le&#383;s humid and clammy, and con&#383;equently Plants, and Herbs
better fermented, concocted, and le&#383;s Rheumatick, than &#383;ince,
and pre&#383;ently after; to &#383;ay nothing of the infinite Numbers of
putrid Carca&#383;&#383;es of Dead

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page81" name="page81"></a>[81]</span>

Animals, peri&#383;hing in the Flood, (of which I find few, if any, have
taken notice) which needs mu&#383;t have corrupted the Air: Tho&#383;e
who live in Mar&#383;hes, and Uliginous Places (like the Hundreds of
<i>E&#383;&#383;ex</i>) being more obnoxious to <i>Fevers</i>,
<i>Agues</i>, <i>Pleuri&#383;ies</i>, and generally unhealthful: The
Earth al&#383;o then a very Bog, compar'd with what it likely was before
that de&#383;tructive <i>Catacly&#383;m</i>, when Men breath'd the pure
<i>Paradi&#383;ian</i> Air, &#383;ucking in a more
<i>&aelig;thereal</i>, nouri&#383;hing, and baulmy <i>Pabulum</i>,
&#383;o foully vitiated now, thro' the Intemperance, Luxury, and
&#383;ofter Education and Effeminacy of the Ages &#383;ince.

</p><p>

<i>Cu&#383;tom</i>, and <i>Con&#383;titution</i> come next to be
examin'd, together with the Qualities, and <i>Vertue</i> of the Food;
and I confe&#383;s, the two fir&#383;t, e&#383;pecially that of
<i>Con&#383;titution</i>, &#383;eems to me the more likely Cau&#383;e of
Health, and con&#383;equently of Long-life; which induc'd me to
con&#383;ider of what Quality the u&#383;ual <i>Sallet</i> Furniture did
more eminently con&#383;i&#383;t, that &#383;o it might become more
&#383;afely applicable to the Temper, Humour, and Di&#383;po&#383;ition
of our Bodies; according to which, the various Mixtures might be
regulated and proportion'd: There's no doubt, but tho&#383;e who&#383;e
Con&#383;titutions are Cold and Moi&#383;t, are naturally affected with
Things which are Hot and Dry; as on the contrary, Hot, and

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page82" name="page82"></a>[82]</span>

Dry Complexions, with &#383;uch as cool and refrigerate; which perhaps
made the <i>Junior Gordian</i> (and others like him) prefer the
<i>frigid&aelig; Men&#383;&aelig;</i> (as of old they call'd
<i>Sallets</i>) which, according to <i>Cornelius Cel&#383;us</i>, is the
fitte&#383;t Diet for <i>Obe&#383;e</i> and Corpulent Per&#383;ons, as
not &#383;o Nutritive, and apt to Pamper: And con&#383;equently, that
for the Cold, Lean, and Emaciated; &#383;uch Herby Ingredients
&#383;hould be made choice of, as warm, and cheri&#383;h the Natural
Heat, depure the Blood, breed a laudable Juice, and revive the Spirits:
And therefore my <i>Lord</i>
<a href="#note-69" name="noteref-69" class="noteref"><sup>69</sup></a><i>Bacon</i> &#383;hews what are
be&#383;t Raw, what Boil'd, and what Parts of Plants fitte&#383;t to
nouri&#383;h. <i>Galen</i> indeed &#383;eems to exclude them all,
unle&#383;s well accompanied with their due Correctives, of which we
have taken care: Notwith&#383;tanding yet, that even the mo&#383;t
<i>Crude</i> and <i>Herby</i>, actually Cold and Weak, may potentially
be Hot, and Strengthning, as we find in the mo&#383;t vigorous Animals,
who&#383;e Food is only Gra&#383;s. 'Tis true indeed, Nature has
providentially mingl'd, and dre&#383;s'd a <i>Sallet</i> for them in
every field, be&#383;ides what they di&#383;tingui&#383;h by Smell; nor
que&#383;tion

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page83" name="page83"></a>[83]</span>

I, but Man at fir&#383;t knew what Plants and Fruits were good, before
the Fall, by his Natural Sagacity, and not Experience; which &#383;ince
by Art, and Trial, and long Ob&#383;ervation of their Properties and
Effects, they hardly recover: But in all Events, &#383;uppo&#383;ing
with
<a href="#note-70" name="noteref-70" class="noteref"><sup>70</sup></a><i>Cardan</i>, that Plants nouri&#383;h
little, they hurt as little. Nay, Experience tells us, that they not
only hurt not at all, but exceedingly benefit tho&#383;e who u&#383;e
them; indu'd as they are with &#383;uch admirable Properties as they
every day di&#383;cover: For &#383;ome Plants not only nouri&#383;h
laudably, but induce a manife&#383;t and whole&#383;om Change; as
<i>Onions</i>, <i>Garlick</i>, <i>Rochet</i>, &amp;c. which are both
nutritive and warm; <i>Lettuce</i>, <i>Pur&#383;elan</i>, the
<i>Intybs</i>, &amp;c. and indeed mo&#383;t of the <i>Olera</i>,
refre&#383;h and cool: And as their re&#383;pective Juices being
converted into the Sub&#383;tances of our Bodies, they become
<i>Aliment</i>; &#383;o in regard of their Change and Alteration, we may
allow them <i>Medicinal</i>; e&#383;pecially the greater Numbers, among
which we all this while have skill but of very few (not only in the
Vegetable Kingdom, but in the whole <i>Materia Medica</i>) which may be
ju&#383;tly call'd <i>Infallible Specifics</i>,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page84" name="page84"></a>[84]</span>

and upon who&#383;e Performance we may as &#383;afely depend, as we may
on &#383;uch as familiarly we u&#383;e for a Crude <i>Herb-Sallet;</i>
di&#383;creetly cho&#383;en, mingl'd, and dre&#383;s'd accordingly: Not
but that many of them may be improv'd, and render'd better in Broths,
and Decoctions, than in <i>Oyl</i>, <i>Vinegar</i>, and other Liquids
and Ingredients: But as this holds not in all, nay, perhaps in few
comparatively, (provided, as I &#383;aid, the Choice, Mixture,
Con&#383;titution, and <i>Sea&#383;on</i> rightly be under&#383;tood) we
&#383;tand up in Defence and Vindication of our <i>Sallet</i>,
again&#383;t all Attacks and Oppo&#383;ers whoever.

</p><p>

We have mentioned <i>Sea&#383;on</i> and with the great
<i>Hippocrates</i>, pronounce them more proper for the Summer, than the
Winter; and when tho&#383;e Parts of Plants us'd in <i>Sallet</i> are
yet tender, delicate, and impregnated with the Vertue of the Spring, to
cool, refre&#383;h, and allay the Heat and Drought of the Hot and
<i>Bilious</i>, Young and over-<i>Sanguine</i>, Cold, <i>Pituit</i>, and
Melancholy; in a word, for Per&#383;ons of all Ages, Humours, and
Con&#383;titutions what&#383;oever.

</p><p>

To this of the <i>Annual Sea&#383;ons</i>, we add that of <i>Culture</i>
al&#383;o, as of very great Importance: And this is often
di&#383;cover'd in the ta&#383;te and con&#383;equently in the
Goodne&#383;s of &#383;uch Plants and <i>Salleting</i>, as are Rais'd
and brought us

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page85" name="page85"></a>[85]</span>

fre&#383;h out of the Country, compar'd with tho&#383;e which the
Avarice of the <i>Gardiner</i>, or Luxury rather of the Age, tempts them
to force and <i>Re&#383;u&#383;citate</i> of the mo&#383;t
de&#383;irable and delicious Plants.

</p><p>

It is certain, &#383;ays a
<a href="#note-71" name="noteref-71" class="noteref"><sup>71</sup></a>Learned Per&#383;on, that about
populous Cities, where Grounds are over-forc'd for Fruit and early
<i>Salleting</i>, nothing is more unwhol&#383;om: Men in the Country
look &#383;o much more healthy and fre&#383;h; and commonly are longer
liv'd than tho&#383;e who dwell in the Middle and Skirts of va&#383;t
and crowded Cities, inviron'd with rotten Dung, loath&#383;ome and
common Lay Stalls; who&#383;e noi&#383;ome Steams, wafted by the Wind,
poi&#383;on and infect the ambient Air and vital Spirits, with
tho&#383;e pernicious Exhalations, and Materials of which they make the
<i>Hot Beds</i> for the rai&#383;ing tho&#383;e <i>Pr&aelig;coces</i>
indeed, and forward Plants and Roots for the wanton Palate; but which
being corrupt in the Original, cannot but produce malignant and ill
Effects to tho&#383;e who feed upon them. And the &#383;ame was well
ob&#383;erv'd by the <i>Editor</i> of our famous <i>Roger Bacon's</i>
Treati&#383;e concerning the <i>Cure of Old Age</i>, and
<i>Pre&#383;ervation of Youth</i>: There being nothing &#383;o proper
for

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page86" name="page86"></a>[86]</span>

<i>Sallet Herbs</i> and other <i>Edule Plants</i>, as the Genial and
Natural Mould, impregnate, and enrich'd with well-dige&#383;ted
Compo&#383;t (when requi&#383;ite) without any Mixture of Garbage,
odious Carrion, and other filthy Ordure, not half con&#383;um'd and
ventilated and indeed reduc'd to the next Di&#383;po&#383;ition of Earth
it &#383;elf, as it &#383;hould be; and that in Sweet, <a
href="#note-72" name="noteref-72"
class="noteref"><sup>72</sup></a>Ri&#383;ing, Aery and moderately
Perflatile Grounds; where not only <i>Plants</i> but <i>Men</i> do
la&#383;t, and live much longer. Nor doubt I, but that every body would
prefer Corn, and other Grain rais'd from <i>Marle</i>, <i>Chalk</i>,
<i>Lime</i>, and other &#383;weet Soil and Amendments, before that which
is produc'd from the <i>Dunghil</i> only. Be&#383;ide, Experience
&#383;hews, that the Rankne&#383;s of <i>Dung</i> is frequently the
Cau&#383;e of Bla&#383;ts and Smuttine&#383;s; as if the <i>Lord</i> of
the <i>Univer&#383;e</i>, by an Act of vi&#383;ible Providence would
check us, to take heed of all unnatural Sordidne&#383;s and Mixtures. We
&#383;en&#383;ibly find this Difference in Cattle and their
Pa&#383;ture; but mo&#383;t powerfully in <i>Fowl</i>, from &#383;uch as
are nouri&#383;h'd with Corn, &#383;weet and dry Food: And as of
Vegetable <i>Meats</i>, &#383;o of <i>Drinks</i>, 'tis ob&#383;erv'd,
that the &#383;ame Vine, according to the


<span class="pagenum"><a id="page87" name="page87"></a>[87]</span>

Soil, produces a <i>Wine</i> twice as heady as in the &#383;ame, and a
le&#383;s forc'd Ground; and the like I believe of all other Fruit, not
to determine any thing of the <i>Peach</i> &#383;aid to be Poi&#383;on
in <i>Per&#383;ia</i>; becau&#383;e 'tis a <i>Vulgar Error</i>.

</p><p>

Now, becau&#383;e among other things, nothing more betrays its unclean
and &#383;purious Birth than what is &#383;o impatiently longed after as
<i>Early A&#383;paragus</i>, &amp;c.
<a href="#note-73" name="noteref-73" class="noteref"><sup>73</sup></a>Dr.
<i>Li&#383;ter</i>, (according to his communicative and obliging Nature)
has taught us how to rai&#383;e &#383;uch as our <i>Gardiners</i> cover
with na&#383;ty Litter, during the Winter; by rather laying of Clean and
Sweet <i>Wheat-Straw</i> upon the Beds,
<i>&#383;uper-&#383;eminating</i> and over-&#383;trowing them thick with
the Powder of brui&#383;ed <i>Oy&#383;ter-Shells</i>, &amp;c. to produce
that mo&#383;t tender and delicious <i>Sallet</i>. In the mean while, if
nothing will &#383;atisfie &#383;ave what is rais'd <i>Ex tempore</i>,
and by Miracles of Art &#383;o long before the time; let them &#383;tudy
(like the <i>Adepti</i>) as did a very ingenious Gentleman whom I knew;
That having &#383;ome Friends of his accidentally come to Dine with him,
and wanting an early Sallet, Before they &#383;ate down to Table,
&#383;owed <i>Lettuce</i> and &#383;ome other Seeds in a certain
Compo&#383;ition of Mould he had prepared; which within the

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page88" name="page88"></a>[88]</span>

&#383;pace of two Hours, being ri&#383;en near two Inches high,
pre&#383;ented them with a delicate and tender <i>Sallet</i>; and this,
without making u&#383;e of any nau&#383;eous or ful&#383;ome Mixture;
but of Ingredients not altogether &#383;o cheap perhaps. <i>Honoratus
Faber</i> (no mean <i>Philo&#383;opher</i>) &#383;hews us another Method
by &#383;owing the Seeds &#383;teep'd in <i>Vinegar</i>, ca&#383;ting on
it a good quantity of <i>Bean-Shell</i> A&#383;hes, irrigating them with
<i>Spirit of Wine</i>, and keeping the Beds well cover'd under dry
Matts. Such another Proce&#383;s for the rai&#383;ing early <i>Peas</i>
and <i>Beans</i>, &amp;c. we have the like

they practicable and certain, I confe&#383;s I &#383;hould not be fonder

Country-man's Field, and Good Wife's Garden &#383;ea&#383;onably
produce; where they are legitimately born in ju&#383;t time, and without
forcing Nature.

But to return again to <i>Health</i> and <i>Long Life</i>, and the
Whole&#383;omne&#383;s of the Herby-Diet,
<a href="#note-75" name="noteref-75" class="noteref"><sup>75</sup></a><i>John

great Friend to them; Affirming Fle&#383;h-Eaters to be much wi&#383;er

I know what is pretended of our Bodies being compo&#383;ed of
<i>Di&#383;&#383;imilar</i> Parts, and &#383;o requiring Variety of
Food: Nor do I reject the Opinion, keeping to the &#383;ame
<i>Species</i>; of which there is infinitely more Variety in the
<i>Herby</i> Family, than in all Nature be&#383;sides: But the Danger is
in the <i>Generical</i> Difference of <i>Fle&#383;h</i>,
<i>Fi&#383;h</i>, <i>Fruit</i>, &amp;c. with other made Di&#383;hes and
exotic Sauces; which a wanton and expen&#383;ive

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page90" name="page90"></a>[90]</span>

Luxury has introduc'd; debauching the Stomach, and &#383;harpening it to
devour things of &#383;uch difficult Concoction, with tho&#383;e of more
ea&#383;ie Dige&#383;tion, and of contrary Substances, more than it can
well di&#383;pose of: Otherwi&#383;e Food of the &#383;ame kind would do
us little hurt: So true is that of
<a href="#note-78" name="noteref-78" class="noteref"><sup>78</sup></a><i>Cel&#383;us</i>, <i>Eduntur
facilius; ad concoctionem autem materi&aelig;, genus, &amp; modus
pertineat</i>. They are (&#383;ays he) ea&#383;ily eaten and taken in:
But regard &#383;hould be had to their Dige&#383;tion, Nature, Quantity
and Quality of the Matter. As to that of <i>Di&#383;&#383;imilar</i>
Parts, requiring this contended for Variety: If we may judge by other
Animals (as I know not why we may not) there is (after all the late
Conte&#383;ts about <i>Comparative Anatomy</i>) &#383;o little
Difference in the Structure, as to the U&#383;e of tho&#383;e Parts and
Ve&#383;&#383;els de&#383;tin'd to &#383;erve the Offices of Concoction,
Nutrition, and other Separations for Supply of Life, <i>&amp;c.</i> That
it does not appear why there &#383;hould need any Difference at all of
Food; of which the mo&#383;t &#383;imple has ever been e&#383;teem'd the
be&#383;t, and mo&#383;t whol&#383;ome; according to that of the <a

This then premis'd (as I &#383;ee no Rea&#383;on why it &#383;hould not)
and that during all this Space they liv'd on <i>Fruits</i> and
<i>Sallets</i>; 'tis little probable, that after their
Tran&#383;gre&#383;&#383;ion, and that they had forfeited their Dominion
over the Creature (and were &#383;entenc'd and exil'd to a Life of Sweat
and Labour on a cur&#383;ed and ungrateful Soil) the offended God
&#383;hould regale them with Pampering <i>Fle&#383;h</i>, or &#383;o

if at any time they had Permi&#383;&#383;ion, it was for any thing
&#383;ave Skins to cloath them, or in way of Adoration, or
<i>Holocau&#383;t</i> for Expiation, of which nothing of the

Command of <i>Almighty God</i> were not enough, it &#383;eems
&#383;ufficiently intimated; becau&#383;e <i>Blood</i> was the
<i>Vehicle</i> of the <i>Life</i> and <i>Animal Soul</i> of the
Creature: For what other my&#383;terious Cau&#383;e, as haply its being
always dedicated to <i>Expiatory Sacrifices</i>, &amp;c. it is not for
us to enquire. 'Tis &#383;aid, that <i>Ju&#383;tin Martyr</i> being
asked, why the <i>Chri&#383;tians</i> of his time were permitted the
eating <i>Fle&#383;h</i> and not the <i>Blood</i>? readily
an&#383;wer'd, That God might di&#383;tingui&#383;h them from
Bea&#383;ts, which eat them both together. 'Tis likewi&#383;e urg'd,
that by the <i>Apo&#383;tolical Synod</i> (when the re&#383;t of the
<i>Jewi&#383;h</i> Ceremonies and Types were aboli&#383;h'd) this
Prohibition was mention'd as a thing
<a href="#note-99" name="noteref-99" class="noteref"><sup>99</sup></a><i>nece&#383;&#383;ary</i>, and rank'd
with <i>Idolatry</i>, which was not to be local or temporary; but
univer&#383;ally injoyn'd to converted Strangers and

neglecting to ob&#383;erve it, concern them alone, after &#383;o many

who tran&#383;gre&#383;s'd, &#383;o &#383;everely puni&#383;h'd, as by
an <i>Imperial Law</i> to be &#383;courg'd to <i>Blood</i> and Bone:

But leaving this Controver&#383;ie (<i>ne nimium extra oleas</i>) it has
often been objected, that <i>Fruit</i>, and <i>Plants</i>, and all other
things, may &#383;ince the Beginning, and as the World grows older, have
univer&#383;ally become <i>Eff&oelig;te</i>, impair'd and diverted of
tho&#383;e Nutritious and tran&#383;cendent Vertues they were at
fir&#383;t endow'd withal: But as this is begging the Que&#383;tion, and

there is any, the lea&#383;t

To this might we add that tran&#383;porting Con&#383;ideration, becoming

Di&#383;h, with a Strew of Sugar and &#383;tore of the Juice of Orange:
&#383;ome affect to have it fryed a little brown and cri&#383;p</i>.

</p>
<p>

31. Tart <i>of</i> Herbs. <i>An</i> Herb-Tart <i>is made thus: Boil
fre&#383;h Cream or Milk, with a little grated Bread or</i>
Naples-Bi&#383;cuit <i>(which is better) to thicken it; a pretty
Quantity of Chervile, Spinach, Beete (or what other Herb you
plea&#383;e) being fir&#383;t par-boil'd and chop'd. Then add</i>
Macaron, <i>or Almonds beaten to a Pa&#383;te, a little &#383;weet
Butter, the Yolk of five Eggs, three of the Whites rejected</i>.

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page144" name="page144"></a>[144]</span>

<i>To the&#383;e &#383;ome add Corinths plump'd in Milk, or boil'd
therein, Sugar, Spice at Di&#383;cretion, and &#383;tirring it all
together over the Fire, bake it in the Tart-Pan</i>.

</p>
<p>

32. Thi&#383;tle. <i>Take the long Stalks of the middle Leaf of the</i>
Milky-Thi&#383;tle, <i>about</i> May, <i>when they are young and tender:
wa&#383;h and &#383;crape them, and boil them in Water, with a little
Salt, till they are very &#383;oft, and &#383;o let them lie to drain.
They are eaten with fre&#383;h Butter melted not too thin, and is a
delicate and whol&#383;ome Di&#383;h. Other Stalks of the &#383;ame kind
may &#383;o be treated, as the</i> Bur, <i>being tender and
di&#383;armed of its Prickles</i>, &amp;c.

</p>
<p>

33. Trufles, <i>and other</i> Tubers, <i>and</i> Boleti, <i>are
roa&#383;ted whole in the</i> Embers; <i>then &#383;lic'd and
&#383;tew'd in &#383;trong Broth with Spice</i>, &amp;c. <i>as</i>
Mu&#383;hroms <i>are. Vide</i> Acetar. p. <a href="#page28">28</a>.

</p>
<p>

34. Turnep. <i>Take their Stalks (when they begin to run up to
&#383;eed) as far as they will ea&#383;ily break downwards: Peel and tie
them in Bundles. Then boiling them as they do</i> Sparagus, <i>are to be
eaten with melted Butter. La&#383;tly</i>,

</p>
<p>

35. Minc'd, <i>or</i> Sallet-all-sorts.

<i>Take Almonds blanch'd in cold Water, cut them round and thin, and
&#383;o leave them in the</i>

<i>Water; Then have pickl'd Cucumbers, Olives, Cornelians, Capers,
Berberries, Red-Beet, Buds of</i> Na&#383;turtium, <i>Broom</i>, &amp;c.
<i>Pur&#383;lan-stalk, Sampier, A&#383;h-Keys, Walnuts, Mu&#383;hrooms
(and almo&#383;t of all the pickl'd Furniture) with Rai&#383;ins of the
Sun &#383;ton'd, Citron and Orange-Peel, Corinths (well clean&#383;ed
and dried)</i> &amp;c. <i>mince them &#383;everally (except the
Corinths) or all together; and &#383;trew them over with any Candy'd
Flowers, and &#383;o di&#383;pose of them in the &#383;ame Di&#383;h
both mixt, and by them&#383;elves. To the&#383;e add roa&#383;ted</i>
Maroons, Pi&#383;tachios, Pine-Kernels, <i>and of Almonds four times as
much as of the re&#383;t, with &#383;ome Ro&#383;e-water. Here al&#383;o
come in the Pickled Flowers and Vinegar in little</i> China
<i>Di&#383;hes. And thus have you an Univer&#383;al</i> Winter-Sallet,
<i>or an</i> All &#383;ort <i>in Compendium, fitted for a City
Fea&#383;t, and di&#383;tingui&#383;hed from the</i> Grand-Sallet:
<i>which &#383;hou'd con&#383;i&#383;t of the Green blanch'd and
unpickled, under a &#383;tately</i> Penna&#383;h <i>of</i> Sellery,
<i>adorn'd with Buds and Flowers</i>.

</p>
<p>

<i>And thus have we pre&#383;ented you a Ta&#383;te of our</i>
Engli&#383;h Garden Hou&#383;ewifry <i>in the matter of</i> Sallets:
<i>And though &#383;ome of them may be Vulgar, (as are mo&#383;t of the
be&#383;t things;) Yet &#383;he was willing to impart them, to &#383;hew
the Plenty, Riches and Variety of the</i> Sallet-Garden: <i>And to
ju&#383;tifie</i>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page146" name="page146"></a>[146]</span>

<i>what has been a&#383;&#383;erted of the Po&#383;&#383;ibility of
living (not unhappily) on</i> Herbs <i>and</i> Plants, <i>according
to</i> Original <i>and</i> Divine In&#383;titution, <i>improved by Time
and long Experience. And if we have admitted</i> Mu&#383;hroms <i>among
the re&#383;t (contrary to our Intention, and for Rea&#383;ons
given</i>, Acet. p. <a href="#page43">43</a>.) <i>&#383;ince many will
by no means abandon them, we have endeavoured to pre&#383;erve them from
tho&#383;e pernicious Effects which are attributed to, and really in
them: We cannot tell indeed whether they were &#383;o treated and
accommodated for the mo&#383;t Luxurious of the</i> C&aelig;&#383;arean
Tables, <i>when that Monarchy was in its highe&#383;t Strain of</i>
Epicuri&#383;m, <i>and ingro&#383;s'd this</i> Haugout <i>for their
&#383;econd Cour&#383;e; whil&#383;t this we know, that 'tis but
what</i> Nature <i>affords all her Vagabonds under every Hedge</i>.

</p><p>

<i>And now, that our</i> Sallets <i>may not want a Gla&#383;s of
generous Wine of the &#383;ame Growth with the re&#383;t of the Garden
to recommend it, let us have your Opinion of the following</i>.

</p>
<p>

Cow&#383;lip-Wine. <i>To every Gallon of Water put two Pounds of</i>
Sugar; <i>boil it an Hour, and &#383;et it to cool: Then &#383;pread a
good brown</i> Toa&#383;t <i>on both Sides with Yea&#383;t: But before
you make u&#383;e of it, beat &#383;ome Syrup of</i> Citron <i>with it,
an Ounce and half of Syrup to each Gallon of Liquor: Then put in the</i>
Toa&#383;t <i>whil&#383;t hot, to a&#383;&#383;i&#383;t its</i>
Fermentation,

<span class="pagenum"><a id="page147" name="page147"></a>[147]</span>

<i>which will cea&#383;e in two Days; during which time ca&#383;t in
the</i> Cow&#383;lip-Flowers <i>(a little brui&#383;ed, but not much
&#383;tamp'd) to the Quantity of half a Bu&#383;hel to ten Gallons (or
rather three Pecks) four</i> Limons <i>&#383;lic'd, with the Rinds and
all. La&#383;tly, one Pottle of</i> White <i>or</i> Rheni&#383;h Wine;
<i>and then after two Days, tun it up in a &#383;weet Cask. Some leave
out all the Syrup</i>.

</p><p>

<i>And here, before we conclude, &#383;ince there is nothing of more
con&#383;tant U&#383;e than good Vinegar; or that has &#383;o near an
Affinity to all our</i> Acetaria, <i>we think it not ami&#383;s to add
the following (much approved) Receit</i>.

</p><p>

Vinegar. <i>To every Gallon of Spring Water let there be allowed three
Pounds of</i> Malaga-Rai&#383;ins: <i>Put them in an Earthen Jarr, and
place them where they may have the hotte&#383;t Sun, from</i> May till
Michaelmas: <i>Then pre&#383;&#383;ing them well, Tun the Liquor up in a
very &#383;trong Iron-Hooped Ve&#383;&#383;el to prevent its
bur&#383;ting. It will appear very thick and muddy when newly
pre&#383;s'd, but will refine in the Ve&#383;&#383;el, and be as clear
as Wine. Thus let it remain untouched for three Months, before it be
drawn off, and it will prove Excellent</i> Vinegar.

</p><p>

Butter. Butter <i>being likewi&#383;e &#383;o frequent and
nece&#383;&#383;ary an Ingredient to divers of the foregoing</i>
Appendants: <i>It &#383;hould be carefully melted, that it turn not to
an Oil; which is prevented by melting

</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page148" name="page148"></a>[148]</span>
<i>

it lei&#383;urely, with a little fair Water at the Bottom of the
Di&#383;h or Pan; and by continual &#383;haking and &#383;tirring, kept
from boiling or over-heating, which makes it rank</i>.

</p><p>

<i>Other rare and exqui&#383;ite</i> Liquors <i>and Teas (Products of
our</i> Gardens <i>only) we might &#383;uper-add, which we leave to
our</i> Lady Hou&#383;ewives, <i>who&#383;e Province indeed all this
while it is</i>.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
